# Eval Pipeline
The evaluation pipeline is useful when you're looking to compare and evaluate key metrics between different language model (LLM) candidates. Users can either pass pre-compiled ground truth data or simply generate synthetic Q&A data from your ingested datasets. Users can evaluate metrics such as Similarity score, MRR and Hit Rate for each Q&A pair. Additional metrics can also be easily extended to include evaluations like Correctness, Faithfulness, etc.


## Pipeline Description:

- **Vectorstore Reader (Weaviate):**
  - **Kind:** Specifies the type of vectorstore reader, which in this case is `Weaviate`.
  - **Provider:** Indicates the provider of the vectorstore reader, which is `dkubex`.
  - **Properties:** Lists the properties of the Weaviate vectorstore reader, including `paperchunks` and `dkubexfm`.

- **Questions Generator:**
  - **Prompt Strategy:** Defines the strategy for generating prompts. In null, the default prompt is used.
  - **Number of Questions per Chunk:** Specifies the number of questions to generate per data chunk.
  - **Maximum Chunks:** Sets the maximum number of data chunks to generate questions for.
  - **LLM:** Determines the language model (LLM) to use for generating questions. The default is `openai` but can be switched to `dkubex`.
  - **LLM Key:** Requires providing the API key for the chosen LLM (OpenAI in this case).
  - **Maximum Tokens:** Specifies the maximum number of tokens allowed in each question prompt.

- **Retrieval Evaluator:**
  - **Vector Retriever:**
    - **Kind:** Indicates the type of vector retriever, which is `Weaviate`.
    - **Provider:** Specifies the provider of the vector retriever, which is `dkubex`.
    - **Text Key:** Refers to the key used to access the text data within the vector retriever, which is `paperchunks`.
    - **Embedding Model:** Specifies the name of the embedding model used for text representation, in this case, `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` from Huggingface.
    - **Similarity Top K:** Sets the number of similar items to retrieve for each query.
  - **Metrics:** Specifies the evaluation metrics used for retrieval evaluation, which include `mrr` (Mean Reciprocal Rank) and `hit_rate`.

- **Semantic Similarity Evaluator:**
  - **Prompt Strategy:** Similar to the Questions Generator, it defines the strategy for similarity evaluation.
  - **LLM:** Specifies the language model (LLM) to use for semantic similarity evaluation, which is `dkubex` in this configuration.
  - **LLM Key:** Labeled `dummy` in case of local deployments available within DKubeX or used to pass auth key if using an external endpoint.
  - **LLM URL:** Indicates the URL where the chosen LLM service is deployed. Available in the deployments tab of DKubeX for local deployments.
  - **Maximum Tokens:** Specifies the maximum number of tokens allowed in each semantic similarity evaluation prompt.
  - **Metrics:** Specifies the evaluation metric used for semantic similarity evaluation, which is the `similarity_score`.

- **Tracking:**
  - **Experiment Name:** Provides a unique name for the MLFlow experiment, allowing for tracking and comparison of different runs of the pipeline. 

## Command for Evaluation

```
d3x dataset evaluate -d <dataset-name> --config <path to your config file>
```

> [!TIP]
> You can track the evaluation flow under the experiments tab in MLFlow.
