These funds could be used for up to two years, and marketplaces would have to be financially self-sustaining by 2025. States would certainly be interested in this funding: leaders in Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania have all announced plans to transition from HealthCare.gov to state-based marketplaces, following in the footsteps of a successful transition by Nevada.\nHR 1425 would provide states with $200 million in federal grant funding to establish state-based marketplaces.

States could thus choose to spend federal funds on reinsurance (as 12 states have already done) or on enhanced ACA subsidies (as California has recently done). Federal funding for these types of efforts would allow for experimentation and state-specific approaches.\nSecond, beginning in 2022, the bill would provide $10 billion in annual funding for states to 1) establish an individual market reinsurance program (which would not include grandfathered plans, transitional plans, or student health insurance coverage); or 2) reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs for marketplace enrollees.

Approval would span five years total and could be revoked by HHS if a state failed to use the money as required. If a state did not apply for these funds, HHS would operate a reinsurance program in that state using an attachment point model.\nStates would have to apply for these funds but would be automatically approved unless the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) notified the state otherwise.

States could use the funding to 1) explore ways to streamline their enrollment procedures (such as experimenting with auto-enrollment); 2) invest in technology to improve data collection and sharing; 3) implement a state-level individual mandate; and/or 4) conduct a feasibility study to develop a plan to increase enrollment.\nThird, the bill would authorize $200 million annually in federal grants from 2022 to 2024 for states to develop innovative solutions to increase enrollment in the individual and small group coverage.
