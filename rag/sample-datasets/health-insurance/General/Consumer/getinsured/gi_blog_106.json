At a high level, these programs provide payments to health insurers to help offset the costs of certain medical claims. These savings, in turn, are passed down to the consumer in the form of lower premiums than the insurers would be able to offer otherwise.\nTo date, 14 states have leveraged 1332 waivers to set up health insurance reinsurance programs to help lower premiums. At a high level, these programs provide payments to health insurers to help offset the costs of certain medical claims. These savings, in turn, are passed down to the consumer in the form of lower premiums than the insurers would be able to offer otherwise.\nThrough 1332 waivers, states ensure that part of their reinsurance funding comes from the federal government pass-through funds. (You can see how that dollar amount is calculated here.) Currently, the pass-through dollars are two to three times the states investment, setting up a significant reinsurance pool. Even though 1332 waivers can be used for a variety of innovative changes, virtually all of the 1332 waiver proposals that have been submitted and approved by CMS have been for the purpose of establishing reinsurance programs.\nThrough 1332 waivers, states ensure that part of their reinsurance funding comes from the federal government pass-through funds.

By using a 1332 waiver, the state gets to keep the savings and use it to fund the reinsurance program. That money is referred to as pass-through savings since its passed through to the state.\nThe idea is that the reinsurance program lowers the cost of health insurance, which means that premium subsidies dont have to be as large in order to keep coverage affordable, and that saves the federal government money (since premium subsidies are funded by the federal government).

That money is referred to as pass-through savings since its passed through to the state.\nStates generally need to come up with some of the funds for reinsurance on their own, so theres often an assessment on insurance plans in the state in order to raise the revenue that the state needs to fund its reinsurance program. But states can take creative approaches to come up with the funding they need.(1) For example, New Jersey will pull funds from the New Jersey Health Insurance Market Preservation Act, which requires residents to maintain health insurance coverage or make a Shared Responsibility Payment. Virginia initially proposed instituting a tobacco tax to fund its reinsurance pool but has since decided to move in another (not yet defined) direction. A state making the move off of the FFM, like Virginia, could easily fund its reinsurance pool with the estimated savings of operating a state-based marketplace. Nevada, for instance, estimated their savings to be 50 percent. Actual savings ultimately depend on the size of the states enrollment and premium costs.\nStates generally need to come up with some of the funds for reinsurance on their own, so theres often an assessment on insurance plans in the state in order to raise the revenue that the state needs to fund its reinsurance program.
