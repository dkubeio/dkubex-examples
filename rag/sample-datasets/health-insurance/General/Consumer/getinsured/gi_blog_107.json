While the FFM denied such requests, 12 of the 13 states operating a state-based exchange (SBE) opened extended special enrollment periods to assist uninsured residents. Now, as we approach the 2021 open enrollment period, FFM states are once again asking the federal government for assistance by way of an extended open enrollment period, as they are unable to change their own dates.\nEarlier this year when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit the U.S., many states operating on the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM), including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, \nurged the federal government\n to open a Special Enrollment Period for health insurance.

Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance Mark Afable says:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic fallout have magnified the importance of quality, affordable health coverage. The pandemic has likely increased the need for health insurance while posing enrollment challenges, especially for those who might be new to the HealthCare.gov marketplace and need assistance in signing up. An Open Enrollment period extension would allow additional outreach and assistance to those who may have lost coverage due to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic fallout have magnified the importance of quality, affordable health coverage.
