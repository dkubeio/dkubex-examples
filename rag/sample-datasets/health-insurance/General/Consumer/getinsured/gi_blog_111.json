The new financial help went to about 47 percent of consumers applying in the 400 to 600 percent FPL income bracket. The average state subsidy to eligible households is $504 per month, lowering their monthly premium by nearly half.\nFlexibility to extend Open Enrollment or institute a SEP\n. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has left millions\n of people without health insurance. To offer insurance during this extraordinary situation, state-based marketplaces that chose to do so, have been able to respond quickly and open SEPs for uninsured residents.\n\n\n\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic is a great example of a states ability to implement new policies the federal exchange doesnt, said Heather Korbulic, Executive Director of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, the state agency that connects Nevadans to qualified health plans through \nNevada Health Link\n.\nWe were able to open up an Exceptional Circumstance Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to allow any uninsured Nevadans to enroll in a plan. But the benefits of operating a state exchange extend beyond SEPs; we can extend our open enrollment period if we decide that makes sense, we have better control of data to execute more targeted marketing programs, and we can customize offerings. This was the first year a consumer had the ability to buy a dental plan without a qualified health plan, for example, which is not possible on the federal exchange.\nWe were able to open up an Exceptional Circumstance Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to allow any uninsured Nevadans to enroll in a plan.
