When the level of intensity began to ramp up a few weeks ago, the call center put in place an emergency plan, anticipating what might be coming down the road and how to provide uninterrupted service to callers. But then suddenly the what might be became orders to shelter-in-place in four Georgia counties, both activating and accelerating the emergency plan. We needed to ensure a seamless, and quick, transition to move the entire call center staff to a remote workforce. The leadership team didnt miss a beat and had each agent set up to work from home, while meeting all compliance regulations, in time for the lockdown deadlines. \nJust like every other business in the country, our call center has had to adjust to life in the face of a pandemic.

When natural disasters strike  fires, hurricanes, or tornadoes  its not unusual to have a special enrollment period. So, on some level, for our call center staff, this is business as usual. This is, however, the first pandemic weve all been through and the first the time we have handled a multi-state special enrollment period while moving our call center from brick and mortar to a remote model at a time when call center volume has, no doubt, been higher than usual. Twelve of the thirteen state-based exchanges have opened up special enrollment periods to give uninsured residents a chance to enroll in a health plan, as confirmed virus cases continue to rise across the country.\nThe COVID-19 special enrollment period (SEP) isnt the first exceptional circumstance our call center has been through.

Agents have all undergone sensitivity training as a reminder that a little extra compassion is needed during this time. Since not all states have opened special enrollment periods, not every uninsured individual that calls in will qualify to enroll in a plan. However, agents are well-versed on important life events (e.g. job loss, change in address, etc.) that may trigger an enrollment window, to ensure every person who qualifies is able to enroll in a plan.\nFrom the first COVID-19 SEP launch, agents quickly responded to help consumers figure out their health insurance options during what has become quite an extraordinary public health crisis.
