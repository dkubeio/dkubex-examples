Our solutions give states new opportunities to improve their consumer experience versus their bespoke legacy systems that tend to be expensive to maintain and difficult to scale. Weve proven that having a cloud-based system power health exchanges dramatically reduces its cost, increases flexibility, allows us to conform to each states individual needs, and is a prime reason why GetInsured is a leading state exchange platform provider today.\nToday, GetInsureds technology is currently being leveraged, in five states  California, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, and Washington.
