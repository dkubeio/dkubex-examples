While I dont want to add them, its important to me, and to everyone at GetInsured, that you know we are still working regularly to provide on-time delivery and outstanding support. Saying business-as-usual has taken on new meaning in these times, but we are adjusting to the new normal and I wanted to personally share with you that we are committed to you and our partnership.\nGetInsured is at the center of the first highly affected COVID-19 areas, and we have taken the health of our employees very seriously from the early days of this pandemic. To minimize our employees exposure, from the onset, we had asked any employee showing any signs of illness to work from home until they were symptom-free. We also restricted any non-essential business travel at that time.\nEffective March 12, as the situation was escalating, we asked all employees in Mountain View and Dallas to work remotely  even before the San Francisco area was put under the shelter-in-place order. We have provided our employees and contractors with data-secure, fully-functional remote workstations at home. We have also provided them with training on remote-support tools and data security. Weve been communicating daily with our staff ensuring that all projects are moving forward as planned.\naff ensuring that all projects are moving forward as planned.\nIn regards to our call center, Wednesday, March 25, our Call Center Agents and Customer Support personnel began working from home. Due to the variables outside of our control, weve had to accelerate this process by almost 48 hours and have been able to respond seamlessly due to prior planning.\nIn regards to our call center, Wednesday, March 25, our Call Center Agents and Customer Support personnel began working from home.

Everyone has really come together to lend a helping hand when needed, to provide assistance and guidance to others, and everyone has stayed very committed to their roles. Rest assured GetInsured will maintain the business continuity of all our clients and the consumers we are privileged to serve day in and day out.\nThis pandemic is truly awful.
