This allows consumers nearly an entire month to research the different insurance plans  a total of 27 qualified health plans and 17 dental plans  available on the Exchange for 2020, and determine which is best suitable for their individual or family needs.\nSince early September, Nevadans planning to enroll in health insurance coverage for 2020 have had the opportunity to claim their accounts on the new State Based Exchange website, NevadaHealthLink.com. Powered by GetInsured, the website is open for consumers to designate an agent and indicate if they would like to automatically renew their health insurance policies. It is also open for consumers to compare plans and explore plan benefits, premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, copayments and coinsurance amounts.\nAfter months of testing, planning and intense coordination, the launch of the new website has been a tremendous success. GetInsured mitigated the risks of Nevadas data migration from the federal platform, and minimized disruption for Nevadas consumers, firmly establishing a model for other states interested in following Nevadas path.\nOver the past five years, Nevada Health Link ran its Exchange on the federal platform, HealthCare.gov, to help people shop and enroll in health insurance plans. The Exchange decided to move back to a state-based platform in order to better streamline, cut costs, and increase efficiency; and through a rigorous Request for Proposal process, chose GetInsured to be its partner. The new website is also easier for consumers to navigate, and comes with a customer service hotline  so Nevadans can have their questions answered by customer service representatives. Consumers can also find an agent over the phone by inputting their zip code.\nAccording to the Nevada Exchange, the migration to the new website is going to save the state of Nevada approximately $4 million in Fiscal Year 2021 alone. You can read more about the migration in Nevada Current, learn what Nevadans need to know in Reno Gazette Journal, and find more information about the window shopping in the Nevada Health Link press release.\n\n"}
