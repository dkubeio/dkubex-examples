Unseasonably sunny weather and endless views of the ocean certainly contributed to the success of the event. The User Conference was spurred by the growth of our state-based marketplace implementations, our commitment to transparent communications with our clients, and the desire to share each states learnings. The unanimous verdict from the attendees was that the opportunity to meet face-to-face and engage in open conversations was invaluable. Were already looking forward to the next one.\nThe conference was attended by health policy experts and executives from the state exchanges of California, Idaho, Washington, Nevada, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. The GetInsured executive team and product managers had the opportunity to share our corporate strategy and goals, new feature and functionality upgrades, and improvements planned for this year.\nThe User Conference provided us the ability to discuss shared areas of interests with other state subject matter experts and GetInsured product specialists that will allow for enhancing the technology platform, and usability of the platform, said Jamie Sawyer, Policy and Compliance Manager, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. We look forward to continued collaborative work with both GetInsured, and the other states to continue providing a successful product for Exchange consumers.\nFor two and a half days we engaged in productive discussions about our State-Based Marketplace (SBM) platform through lively interaction, candid feedback, and exploration of hot button issues. We discussed lessons learned to date, our future product roadmap, organizational expansion, and upcoming trends potentially impacting SBMs, such as Individual Coverage HRA (ICHRA) and Enhanced Direct Enrollment (EDE).\nOur state-based marketplace clients span the country and each have their own unique needs, said Paul Neutz, SVP, Business Development. At this conference it was great to see that despite varying requirements, the learning that emerges from sharing a single cloud-based platform offers unique opportunities to gain from the collective knowledge base. It was clear to our customers that sharing a common platform saves every exchange time and money on implementation, operation, and upgrades. This is an ultimate win-win for all of us.\n\n"}
