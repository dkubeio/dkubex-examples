Thats one reason that Insurance Brokers are a critical part of the health insurance enrollment process. Brokers are licensed knowledgeable experts who provide valuableand freeassistance to clients, helping to ensure they enroll in the best plan possible for their unique health and financial circumstances.\nA recent study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that consumers who reach out to brokers have a limited understanding of Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements and benefits and have difficulty understanding basic insurance terms. Brokers play a critical role in educating these consumers, so they better understand their coverage options.\nAs a real-life example, we can look at Idahos state exchange, Your Health Idaho. Brokers have played a key role in consumer enrollments through the exchange. In fact, 70 percent of enrollments through Your Health Idaho are done with broker assistance. Interestingly, consumers that enroll with brokers tend to have coverage longer than those who do not80 percent of Idahoans with nine years of consecutive coverage have worked with a broker.\nNationwide, Plan Year 2023 Open Enrollment Period generated record-breaking numbers with 16.4 million individuals enrolling in health coveragemany through brokers. Now, with the Public Health Emergency (PHE) unwinding in full swing, the number of individuals needing help has increased. All ACA Exchanges can leverage their broker community to engage with individuals to minimize any gaps in coverage during the unwinding. But state-based exchanges offer brokers additional tools and resources to reach customers. \nThe GetInsured state-based exchange platform provides advanced tools specifically designed for brokers, including mobile technology, to provide consumers with a seamless and accessible enrollment experience and simplified year-round support in multiple languages. For example:\nBrokers play a crucial role in assisting consumers, regardless of whether they are using a state-based exchange or HealthCare.gov. To access professional application and enrollment help from a broker, individuals can visit their state exchange website or HealthCare.gov.\n"}
