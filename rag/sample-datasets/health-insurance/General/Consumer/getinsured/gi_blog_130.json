In fact, The Commonwealth Fund recently analyzed some of the areas states with State-Based Marketplaces (SBMs) consistently come out ahead. Some key highlights from the \nstudy\n include: \nSince the third year of the ACA, premium increases have been consistently higher in FFM states. For the past two years, increases between state and federal marketplaces have differed by 21 and 68 percent.\nFor 2018, FFM states projected medical claims that were 18 percent higher than state-based marketplaces. \nInsurers also projected higher administrative costs per member in FFM states, which added to the premium differences.\n\nSo, whats causing the rate differences? State marketplaces have taken the reigns into their own hands when it comes to making health insurance enrollment both profitable and sustainable. They have more control over the enrollment process, marketing campaigns, and even enrollment deadlines. Outreach efforts and enrollment flexibility that best serve their residents have proven effective with more balanced risk pools that not only encourage insurers to stay in the market but to do so with better rates than residents would find on the FFM.\n\nSince the launch of the ACA, technology and operations of state-based marketplaces have evolved as the market and individual state needs have changed.
