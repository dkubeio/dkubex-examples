While the ruling has no immediate impact on the law, the decision will certainly be appealed and will take many months to play out. That fact alone will cause additional uncertainty as to the future of the ACA exchanges, especially for states that use the Federally-Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to support the states insured population. As a result of this uncertainty, we foresee even less investment into healthcare.gov going forward. If your state has been considering setting up its own State-Based Marketplace (SBM), theres never been a better time to do so and take control of your health insurance market.\nBeyond the uncertainty of the future of healthcare.gov, moving to a State-Based Marketplace (SBM) provides a significant opportunity to save money on healthcare in your state. As demonstrated in a March study by the Commonwealth Fund, SBM States outperform their FFM counterparts in many areas. One area of efficiency was in premiums  showing reductions of up to 20 percent.\nOur own research shows that, beyond impacting premiums, states currently running on the FFM can  depending on a number of enrollees  save tens of millions of dollars simply by transitioning to a state-based marketplace, run and operated locally with private-sector support  as 12 states and D.C. already have done.\nThe current administration in general and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in particular intend for states to take control of their own affairs, including managing their health insurance exchanges. This is clear by the latest updates to the 1332 waiver guidance.\nOther advantages in a transition to a State-Based Marketplace, as well as policy ideas and regulations (both current and future) to support a transition, include:\nNevadas transition off of the FFM is anticipated to save the state $6 million annually, while Idaho has been able to operate at a lower fee than the FFM carrier premium fee of 3.5 percent  saving the state approximately $22 million since the transition. These numbers are achievable by your state, too. We can show you just how simple and quick the transition can be. Lets talk.
