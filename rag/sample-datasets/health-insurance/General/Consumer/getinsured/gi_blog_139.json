In other words, not all of the steps needed to complete shopping for and enrolling in an individual plan are available in the same online place.\nInstead, some steps in the process have to take place on healthcare.gov. Shoppers start on a site, are redirected to healthcare.gov to verify their identify and verify whether they are eligible for a premium subsidy, then are redirected back to the original site they started from to pick a plan and enroll in it. This is a cumbersome, confusing and inefficient process and one that has risk for technical problems.\nWhat is the Impact of Eliminating the Double Redirect?\nBy allowing for a better consumer shopping and enrollment experience, access to health care  and thus overall enrollment  will increase. In the past, many people, when faced with the double redirect online process, simply stopped completing an enrollment. Eliminating the double redirect will enable the easy, streamlined experience that consumers, especially younger and healthier ones, expect. And increased enrollment will help to stabilize the individual coverage market.\n* * *\nEntities such as web-based brokers who choose this option need to inform CMS, secure a third-party auditor, identify a service provider to verify identities, and perform testing with CMS, all prior to this falls shortened open enrollment season.\n"}
