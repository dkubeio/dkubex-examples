There are ways to give your brain its own workout routine that involves real-world activities.\nRegular exercise like taking a brisk walk in the park, gardening or yoga can nourish your brain and may be even more important than using your brain to think.

Eat your way to a better brain by keeping your calories in check, reducing your consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol, and remember your B vitamins, B6 and B12 which help fight against dementia, and folic acid. Avoid tobacco and reduce your alcohol consumption.\nStaying socially active has been associated with lower blood pressure and longer life expectancy.

Step out of your comfort zone and seek out others with different interests and hobbies.\nLiving a brain-healthy lifestyle works! Our brains thrive on variety to keep those synapses firing. The more kinds of mentally stimulating activities we engage in, the happier and healthier we will be.\n"}
