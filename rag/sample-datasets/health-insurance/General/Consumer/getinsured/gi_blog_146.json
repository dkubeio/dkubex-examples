SBMs assist citizens and legal residents with applying for marketplace coverage in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). When the law was passed in 2010, each of the 50 states had to decide to either create a state-run health insurance exchange or offer enrollment through a federally-operated exchange. GetInsured is the leader in State-Based Marketplace technology, has provided assistance to states since the inception of the ACA, and has experience spanning eight implementations in State-Based Marketplaces across the country.\nState marketplaces have taken the reigns into their own hands when it comes to making health insurance enrollment both profitable and sustainable. They have more control over the enrollment process, marketing campaigns, and even enrollment deadlines. Outreach efforts and enrollment flexibility that best serve their residents have proven effective with more balanced risk pools that not only encourage insurers to stay in the market but to do so with better rates than residents would find on the FFM.\nSince the launch of the ACA, technology,and operations of State-Based Marketplaces have evolved as the market and individual state needs have changed. There are now mature solutions on the market, deployed, and best practices that can help keep costs down and operations nearly flawless, resulting in sustainable SBMs.\nFor states that have opted to their own health insurance marketplaces in lieu of utilizing Healthcare.gov, GetInsured offers a complete end-to-end solution for states, as well as powerful modular tools which include Consumer Decision Support Tool, Plan Management, Enrollment Reconciliation, Call Compliance, SEP Verification, and Consumer, Agency, Broker and Insurer Portals.
