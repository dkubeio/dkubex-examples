We could see this surface as early as May.\nThings are happening. Republicans have a newfound impetus to get something done. Theres an outside chance that there will be a vote on a third version of the bill. The Freedom Caucus has played an important role. Theyve been working to get votes to pass a healthcare bill. This means that healthcare reform is not dead. Sooner or later there will be a bill passed over to the Senate, perhaps sometime in May. As of Tuesday, they were about 10 votes short. Theres also a lot of work going on in the White House. \nCarriers should stay in the business and be involved. Things are going to happen and everyone in the market should participate and make their views known. \nThings are happening. Republicans have a newfound impetus to get something done.

Payers are looking for ways to stabilize pricing and market fluctuations that have been occurring since 2014, as well as restore losses.\nHealth plans have learned a lot about the market, the types of enrollees and the needs that they have, and the various ways they can manage enrollees and lower the burden of cost. The ongoing application of these lessons and serving these groups is critical. Staying the course in the market can help carriers find the path to stability, though the major onus is on the government.\nRight now, its probably unlikely there will be any Democrat votes for changing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Where youre going to see bipartisanship is when the bill gets to the Senate. You have to look at healthcare as a three-legged stool:\nRight now, its probably unlikely there will be any Democrat votes for changing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Where youre going to see bipartisanship is when the bill gets to the Senate. You have to look at healthcare as a three-legged stool:\nThe first leg is the Republican bill to repeal and replace. This is whats being played out right now in the House. \nThe second leg is the power Tom Price has to change a lot of the Affordable Care Acts composition and benefits under administrative rules. \nThe third leg will be sometime later summer, early fall, when well have to get a bipartisan bill through.\nSecretary Tom Price, the Freedom Caucus and Vice President Mike Pence want to give more power back to the states and allow them to have more flexibility. Transferring more power to the states will benefit the carriers and allow them to develop some good insurance policies. \nSecretary Tom Price, the Freedom Caucus and Vice President Mike Pence want to give more power back to the states and allow them to have more flexibility.

Tom Price would then be faced with implementing the new laws, which would be no small effort.\nWait it out and try to drive the Democrats to the table. Either Tom Price could facilitate the ACA as it has been thus far and wait for it to crumble under its own weight; Not making it stronger, but not subverting the law. Alternatively, the administration could cease payments of cost-sharing reduction subsidies or reinsurance payments which would unravel the market rapidly. If the failure of the ACA will fall upon the Democrats, despite Republican administrative actions, this would drive bipartisan support very quickly. \nRepublicans could disrupt the law through four different vehicles: privatization, a series of regulatory changes, a series of legislative sidecars that could garner bipartisan support, and 1332 and 1115 waivers which would drive state-level reforms.\nWe are a third of the way of what the CBO had forecasted as the market size, so were already operating on a skinnier version of what could have been achieved. The question becomes will enrollment fall below or above the current 10-million enrollee baseline? And what is the ultimate goal of policymakers? Many would say its less about driving down the insured rate and more about driving access and options and competition. Theres a core philosophy that if access and choice are improved, cost could be driven down and enrollment will go up. \nWe are a third of the way of what the CBO had forecasted as the market size, so were already operating on a skinnier version of what could have been achieved.

But this cannot happen in a vacuum, consumer education needs to continue.\nSpeaker Paul Ryans position (and that of many Republicans) is that he wants everyone to have access to health insurance. They want carriers to come up with as many plans as possible, creating as much choice as possible, without being limited by what the federal government tells the exchanges they can sell or not sell. This could make the market more robust, versus diminishing its size. \nSpeaker Paul Ryans position (and that of many Republicans) is that he wants everyone to have access to health insurance.
