Meant to shore up the individual insurance market while the longer-term fate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is determined, its been the subject of much debate during the shorter-than-usual comment period (20 days versus the more typical 60). Heres a high-level look at the key provisions in the final rule released last Thursday, April 13:\n The open enrollment period will be half as long as previous years  November 1 through December 15. There will need to be sufficient consumer education to avoid fewer people enrolling, especially fewer younger people, particularly given the lower than expected numbers of younger/healthier enrollees that weve seen to date.\n  Insurers have more leeway to collect unpaid premiums and to not provide policies to people who have not paid. The idea is that this will encourage more people to have continuous coverage. Previously, insurers had to grant consumers a 90-day grace period before canceling coverage, and coverage could not be denied in subsequent enrollment periods. \n  More controls around SEPs are detailed in the final rule regarding verification, metal coverage upgrades and coverage effective dates. Most notably, documentation will be required regarding SEP circumstances (marriage, divorce, birth, etc.). It will be important to monitor the impact of the additional requirements on younger people who lose employer coverage, again to ensure that we keep as many younger/ healthier people enrolled as possible.\n  There will be more flexibility for insurers around how many Essential Community Providers are in a network, and monitoring of network adequacy will now be performed by states. \nDue to changes in the allowed variation in actuarial value used to determine metal levels of coverage, insurers will be able to offer plans with lower premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs to the member. These plans will appeal to younger, healthier people. But its possible that since the subsidies are tied to the cost of plans, this could have the effect of lowering the value of tax credit subsidies.\nWhether these changes improve choice and lower premiums  thus adding to overall market stabilization as intended  will surely vary widely market by market. \nWhether these changes improve choice and lower premiums  thus adding to overall market stabilization as intended  will surely vary widely market by market. \nThe missing piece for insurers as filing deadlines for 2018 loom is the fate of cost-sharing reduction subsidies. Will the federal government continue to fund these reimbursements to insurers? Without that answer, true stability cant be achieved. And without this continued funding, we can expect higher premiums and further market destabilization.\nThe missing piece for insurers as filing deadlines for 2018 loom is the fate of cost-sharing reduction subsidies.
