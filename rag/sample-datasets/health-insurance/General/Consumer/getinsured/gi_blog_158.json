But some of the more recent discussions by Congressional Republicans have centered around the possibility of allowing states to request waivers for this portion of the law. To get such a waiver, states would need to participate in a high-risk pool, which would either be run by the federal government or established by the state (potentially with some seed money from the federal government). \nTo get such a waiver, states would need to participate in a high-risk pool, which would either be run by the federal government or established by the state (potentially with some seed money from the federal government). \nHigh-risk pools are nothing new. They existed in many states prior to the passage of ACA, and at a federal level early in ACA implementationwhen not all provisions had kicked in. Ultimately, the ACA removed the need for high-risk pools, since insurers could not deny coverage to people due to a pre-existing condition.\nHigh-risk pools are nothing new.

Insurance is based on pooling funds from many people to pay for losses incurred by a few. The higher your risk factors are predicted to be, the more the company will charge, since it believes it is more likely that it will have to pay for services rendered. \nThe idea behind high-risk pools is that by removing the small group of people who significantly skew the overall risk pool, a more stable pool with more affordable pricing for the majority of people insured is established. Views vary on whether high-risk pools discriminate against people who have health problems or whether they help people who have health problems with funding a form of subsidy or charity.\nAt the most basic level, all types of insurance work on the principle of evaluating risk factors and estimating the statistical likelihood that youll cost the insurance company money. \nInsurance is based on pooling funds from many people to pay for losses incurred by a few. \nThe higher your risk factors are predicted to be, the more the company will charge, since it believes it is more likely that it will have to pay for services rendered. \nThe idea behind high-risk pools is that by removing the small group of people who significantly skew the overall risk pool, a more stable pool with more affordable pricing for the majority of people insured is established.

Several factors hampered their success. First, most had benefit-specific and/or lifetime coverage limits, which sick people frequently met. Additionally, some didnt cover pre-existing conditions for a period of time. Most had high deductibles and very expensive premiums. And because funding was an issue, some limited how many people could enroll, and thus there were waiting lists to get coverage. So while, in theory, they were meant to serve the needs of people who have health conditions, they were not always effective.\nThe pre-ACA high-risk pools varied significantly by state.

They are looking to avoid some of the problems of the past by capping premiums and prohibiting wait lists. But its debatable whether $25 billion over 10 years would be sufficient funding if the barriers to enrollment were removed and more sick people join.\nCongressional Republicans are proposing funding state high-risk pools with $25 billion in federal dollars over 10 years. \nThey are looking to avoid some of the problems of the past by capping premiums and prohibiting wait lists.

Reinsurance is essentially insurance for insurers, meaning that they pay into a fund that then covers medical costs above a set threshold and up to a capped amount. With reinsurance, insurers can keep premiums lower as their risk of unexpected costs incurred by sicker people is limited. Everyone stays in the same pool and is offered the same plans, benefits, and networks.\nAn alternative approach, one taken by Alaska, is reinsurance.

Itll be interesting to see how these discussions evolve and how we can best assist insurers as the health insurance landscape changes. \nWhile making plans affordable and avoiding insurer losses are key to achieving market stability, its also critical to ensure that any efforts to take us back to the future with high-risk pools are approached thoughtfully.
