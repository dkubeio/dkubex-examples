But you are healthy and may be wondering if an annual physical is even necessary. For many reasons, its always a good idea to check in with your doctor and your health at least once a year. \nYouve signed up for a health plan and chosen a primary care physician now its time to make an appointment for your annual physical. But you are healthy and may be wondering if an annual physical is even necessary. For many reasons, its always a good idea to check in with your doctor and your health at least once a year. \nWhy? An annual exam can help you focus on living a healthier lifestyle, but also gives your doctor the opportunity to run diagnostic screenings, and discuss any lifestyle activities that may impact your health. Your doctor will have questions for you, but you should also be ready with a list of your own specific to any concerns you may have. \nWhy? An annual exam can help you focus on living a healthier lifestyle, but also gives your doctor the opportunity to run diagnostic screenings, and discuss any lifestyle activities that may impact your health. Your doctor will have questions for you, but you should also be ready with a list of your own specific to any concerns you may have. \nHere are a few to get your list started:\n\n1. Whats my blood pressure?\n\nA blood pressure check, which indicates how hard your heart is working, should be done at least every two years starting at age 18. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a key risk factor for heart disease and stroke, as well as eye problems and kidney disease, and diagnosing and treating it early can help prevent the onset of illness. Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers, the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom). A normal systolic number should be less than 120; a normal diastolic number should be less than 80.\n\n2. What does my family history say about my health?\n\nDont try to figure out if your grandfathers colon cancer or your moms aunts breast cancer is relevant to your medical future  share everything you know with your doctor and let him or her assess. Start with your immediate family  parents, siblings, children  and go from there. \n3. Do I need any screenings or tests?\n\nThe answer to this will depend on your age, gender, health history, but definitely ask and your doctors thoughts on when to consider certain routine screenings. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests mammograms for women every two years starting at age 50  unless you have a family history of breast cancer. The American Cancer Society, on the other hand, recommends annual screenings starting at 40. Guidelines for cervical and prostate cancer screenings have also changed, so talk to your doctor about whats right for you.\n\n4. Do I need any shots?\n\nMost doctors recommend that everyone over 6 months of age should get an annual flu shot. If you have not seen a doctor in a while, you may need a booster vaccine to protect against tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) because the immunity you received as a child will have waned by now. If youre over 65, or have a chronic condition such as asthma or diabetes, you may also need a one-time pneumonia vaccine, called Pneumovax. Or perhaps you dont need any at all! But this is definitely a good conversation to have with your doctor.\n\n5. Um . . .\n\nYes, you should ask that embarrassing question, whether its a strange rash in an awkward place, something to do with your sexual health or history, or past or current substance abuse. Or let your doctor know if something just doesnt feel right. It could be nothing, it could be significant  but remember, your doctor really has heard it all before. And while were on the subject, if youre concerned about sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, ask to be tested.\n\nAnd, of course, if other questions or concerns arise during your visit, dont be afraid to ask. If you are curious as to what a test is for  ask. If youre wondering what you can do to either maintain or improve your health  ask. After all, youre the champion of your own health!\nHere are a few to get your list started:\n\n\n\n\n1.
