Kelly Management Consulting, Chris Condeluci, Principal, CC Law and Policy PLLC, and Jonathan Rickert, SVP Insurer Business, GetInsured. \nLatest update on where policy changes are headed and the impact to group and commercial coverage going forward.\nThere are two ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act  through the legislation process which requires 60 votes, or via the reconciliation process, which requires only 51 votes. What weve seen is a move to repeal certain aspects under the reconciliation process, under which changes must be limited to tax and spending provisions. So, what does that mean?\nAll ACA taxes can be repealed:\nThere are two ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act  through the legislation process which requires 60 votes, or via the reconciliation process, which requires only 51 votes. What weve seen is a move to repeal certain aspects under the reconciliation process, under which changes must be limited to tax and spending provisions. So, what does that mean?\nAll ACA taxes can be repealed:\nThe employer mandate penalty tax will be repealed, and one draft has this repeal being retroactive to 2016. This would mean that employers will no longer have to do the measurement period for full-time employees and they wont have to offer a minimum value plan to avoid penalties. However, current reporting requirements will not be repealed under reconciliation because it helps IRS determine subsidy eligibility and subsidies will be sticking around for a while.\nThe Cadillac Tax, which is currently delayed until 2020, will be repealed in reconciliation. The question that remains is whether Republicans will replace it with a new cap. If a new cap replaces the Cadillac Tax, employers will want to ensure their coverage falls below the cap to avoid a tax.\nRepublicans also want to expand health savings accounts (HSAs). Proposals include doubling contribution limit, allowing spouses to make catch-up contributions, and allowing funds in HSAs to be used for medical expenses that occurred up to 60 days prior to HSA establishment.\nRepublicans also want to expand health savings accounts (HSAs).

Provisions such as adult children remaining on their parents plans, lifetime limits, and guarantee of coverage wont be affected. These would need to be changed through regulations directly from HHS.\nThere are some things that cannot be changed via the reconciliation process, specifically insurance market reforms under the ACA.

Employees are looking for more self-service that would give them the ability to update qualifying life events online. Insurers that have implemented such changes have found that features like these create stickiness with their plans, and employers find that it cuts down on employee education costs.\nInsurers are looking for ways to automate enrollment and provide decision support to make the enrollment process less cumbersome.

Prior to 2013, consumers had largely enrolled in plans through agents and brokers. Post-ACA, elderly consumers are also much more willing to enroll online for direct enrollment. So what weve seen is a move in the health insurance market where enrollment functions more like a consumer product  the amazon.com-ing of the market.\nAfter the ACA, we saw a rapid change in the market; individuals were willing to enroll in individual coverage online.

Under the new law, small employers are allowed to make tax-free contributions into a health reimbursement account (HRA) for their employees to purchase plans on the individual marketplace. There are, however, some constraints:\nProvisions under the SHBRA are only available to employers with 50 employees or less (these employers are also not subject to the employer mandate).

Leadership in Washington tends to be more states-rights focused so selling across state lines doesnt necessarily align with their ideology. Overall, there are a lot of issues that would make this a slow-moving issue.\nSome arguments say that there wont be much of a differencebecause its difficult to build the interstate networks and execute.

However, a full 50-state interstate commerce situation is unlikely to occur. \nThere is potential in states where there are naturally occurring regional markets for sale of plans across state lines; this would be upto the affected states.
