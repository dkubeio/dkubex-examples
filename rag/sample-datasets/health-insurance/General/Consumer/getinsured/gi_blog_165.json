Spring allergies can last from February and continue into summer, though the allergens change along the way. Typically during these months, though, tree pollen, grasses, and weeds are to blame for your runny nose and itchy eyes. \nWhile you may be running to the medicine cabinet for your antihistamines, there are other ways to help yourself out as the outside world comes back to life:\nIt may feel great to open up those windows and let the warm air breeze through your house, but if youre an allergy sufferer, youre letting in more than just fresh air. Keep your windows closed and opt for indoor fans to help keep pollen out of your home. \nVacuum at least twice a week and make sure your vacuum has a High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) filter. Many allergens can escape your vacuum and end up in the air, where you breathe them in. This is where the HEPA filter comes in. It traps allergens inside the vacuum and keeps them out of your airways. \nWipe down surfaces with a damp cloth to trap any surface allergens.\nUse a nasal rinse to keep your nasal passages clear of allergens. Neti pots are great for keeping passageways clean, but if they seem too overwhelming for you, there are plenty of saline sprays available at your local pharmacy that can help rinse sinuses. \nMake sure youre staying hydrated. Allergies are caused by a histamine reaction and histamine production increases if youre dehydrated. If youre not getting enough water, your body may also not be producing enough antibodies, making it even harder to ward off allergies. While water intake recommendations vary, you can start with the 8-glasses-of-water-a-day rule. Plus, as the weather warms up, its always a good idea to make sure youre getting enough fluids  allergy sufferer or not.\nIf you feel like youve tried everything and your allergies are still getting the best of you, put that health insurance plan to work and ask your doctor for some help in conquering allergy season. \n\nIf you feel like youve tried everything and your allergies are still getting the best of you, put that health insurance plan to work and ask your doctor for some help in conquering allergy season. \n"}
