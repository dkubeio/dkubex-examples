With all the talk of repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act, you may be wondering if you should still enroll, whats going to happen to your tax credits, or if you will be penalized if you dont enroll. Were here to help.\nFirst, yes, if you are uninsured, you should still enroll in a health plan. Even if you have coverage, it pays to shop around to compare this years plans and prices. And while no one can say at this point what will happen as far as a penalty if you arent insured, when you consider that medical bills are still the number one form of bankruptcy in the United States, it pays to be covered. According to a 2015 study released by Johns Hopkins, the average new uninsured patient appointment costs $160. And while that may not seem like a lot, that is the fee for being seen; costs can quickly skyrocket. Johns Hopkins notes that even a medical bill of $100 represents one-tenth of the monthly income of a single adult living at the poverty level.\nWith an increase in monthly premiums seen pretty much across the board this open enrollment period, you may also be wondering if prices will go down in the future under the new administration. Premiums have risen for a number of factors such as the current risk pool balance and plan requirements. While the proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act seek to stabilize and even lower premiums, thats just not something anyone knows at this point. Which brings us to\ntax credits and subsidies. As of now, they still work as they always have. Theyre based on your household income, family size, and zip code. There is a Republican proposal for how tax credits might work after the new administration makes changes to health insurance laws. The new proposal bases tax credit amounts solely on age. To help you see how that may affect you and your family, weve put together a simple online calculator that allows you to compare Affordable Care Act tax credits with the current Republican proposal. Remember though, as of right now, the new amounts are only a proposal and for this current open enrollment, youll want to focus on the Affordable Care Act.\nAt the end of the day, the enrollment deadline is coming; coverage remains important; and as always, we are here to help answer any questions you may have and to help you choose a plan.\n"}
