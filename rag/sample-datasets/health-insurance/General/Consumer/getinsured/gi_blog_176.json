Employers couldnt get a waiver on the penalty to offer the insurance and reduce their income by the money given to an employee. From a health insurance and benefits package perspective, this put small businesses in a bad position.\nThe IRS enacted this law to avoid double-dipping scenarios: employees wouldnt be able to access low-cost marketplace insurance, the premium tax credit, and receive tax-free money from their employer to pay all or part of the premium not covered by the credit.

Section 18001 (the former Small Business Healthcare Relief Act) changed the way small businesses could use HRAs, once again allowing small business owners that dont offer group coverage to contribute to employees HRAs. \nAfter three years of trying to get the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act passed to reverse the HRA ruling, it was bundled the \n21st Century Cures Act\n, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016.

As employers contemplate ways to take advantage of HRAs, insurers and brokers have plenty to consider as well. For insurers with a strong small group business, this change could result in a loss of valuable group members. Being able to enroll those members into individual plans can help retain members for life as people shift between group and individual coverage. \nBut, employers arent the only ones that need to be thinking about these new changes.

Being able to enroll those members into individual plans can help retain members for life as people shift between group and individual coverage. \nAlternatively, insurers can look to this change as a way to build a group business by focusing on the 71 percent of employers who currently offer no coverage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this 71 percent translates to 33 million Americans working in the private sector for a business with 49 or less full-time employees. This is an incredibly large market that insurers will want to cater to. Creating packages that offer both group and individual options for employers to offer their employees can help insurers retain and even grow their business. How can this be best accomplished? \nAlternatively, insurers can look to this change as a way to build a group business by focusing on the 71 percent of employers who currently offer no coverage.

How can this be best accomplished? \nInsurer-led private exchanges can be created so the employees can shop as easily, and in many cases more easily, than on public exchange. Plus, offering a private exchange can help employees better navigate the often hard-to-understand defined contribution approaches. Delivering plan options that show final premiums after applying a tax credit or HRA contribution can help employees make the best financial decisions possible, and makes enrollment simple.\nSince many employers may have both group and some individual coverage options, insurers need systems that can deliver both. \nInsurers should seek out HRA partners so they can offer a turnkey solution to small employers that includes both medical and ancillary products and HRA administration.\n1Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Center for Financing, Access and Cost Trends. 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component \n1\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Center for Financing, Access and Cost Trends. 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component \n"}
