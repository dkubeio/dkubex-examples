At a very high level, the \nCassidy-Collins plan\n proposed three options for states:\nTheyd have to take necessary steps to affirm their choice  either executive or legislative action  but they could decide they like the way things have been working and leave them as such. \nUnder this option, states could auto-enroll uninsured individuals into low premium, high deductible plans that would exist solely to cover catastrophic medical needs. The individual would have to opt-out if they did not wish to be covered by this plan. This is similar to how the Medicare system currently enrolls those aging into Medicare. This option also looks at pre-funding health savings accounts (HSAs) and providing subsidies to those who actively purchase their own coverage agnostic to income. \nIn this scenario, the states would go without federal funding, decide what works best for their population and design their own plan.\nCassidy and Collins note that their plan meets the requirements set forth by President Trump to replace the ACA, expand coverage, cover pre-existing conditions, remove mandates all while lowering the cost of coverage. Like the other plans presented to-date, there is plenty of debate happening on its points and whether or not they are feasible.\n\nCassidy and Collins note that their plan meets the requirements set forth by President Trump to replace the ACA, expand coverage, cover pre-existing conditions, remove mandates all while lowering the cost of coverage.

Like many other proposals, his plan would eliminate the individual mandate. He would also give those with pre-existing conditions a two-year window to enroll in coverage before pre-ACA underwriting would kick in.

House Speaker Paul Ryan told the group that a repeal and replace likely wouldnt happen until March or April. While this is later than Trump had initially promised, Republicans have admitted they would not make the original January 27th deadline.\n, House and Senate Republicans gathered in Philadelphia to try to find agreement on a path forward.
