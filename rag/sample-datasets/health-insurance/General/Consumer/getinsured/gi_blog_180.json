Just as many states began to find their footing, the future of healthcare laws were thrown into flux. While we dont know yet what lays ahead, now is the time for states to take stock of their exchanges, assessing gaps to be filled and assets to be leveraged as the new healthcare landscape emerges.\nA tool businesses use to identify these areas is a SWOT analysis, which pinpoints strengths and weaknesses, and identifies external opportunities and threats. (SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.) Through this exercise, state-based marketplaces (SBMs) can better understand which policy changes may pose the greatest threats to their current business model and where they are nimble enough to take advantage of new policies.\nTo help, we have created a starter SWOT table. It contains a checklist of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that may be relevant to SBMs. While not all of these will be applicable to a specific SBM, the list should provide a launch point for their own exercise.\nDownload Now\n"}
