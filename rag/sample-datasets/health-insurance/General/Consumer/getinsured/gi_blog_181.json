So lets start at the beginning. Youre turning 65, happy birthday!\nGetting Started with Medicare\nIf youre already receiving social security benefits or railroad benefits, youll automatically get Part A (hospitalization) and Part B (doctors services, preventive care, outpatient care, including lab work, X-rays, and medical supplies) starting the first day of the month you turn 65. If your birthday happens to fall on the first day of the month, your coverage will start the first day of the prior month.\nIf youre not already receiving social security or railroad benefits, you become eligible for Medicare when you turn 65, you just have to apply. Theres a seven-month window that begins three months prior to your 65th birthday.\nIf you miss this seven-month window, you can sign up between January 1 through March 31 each year. Your coverage will begin July 1. You may have to pay a higher premium for late enrollment, so if you know youre going to want Medicare, dont delay.\nWith us so far? Okay, good.\nMedicare Advantage and Making Changes to Your Plan\nEach year, there is also an annual election period that allows you to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan (also known as Medicare Part C) or change your current Medicare Advantage plan. This window is from October 15 to December 7. You can make changes to your plan whether you have Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage.\nYou can also enroll in a Medicare Supplement plan during this time, can help pay some of the health care costs that Original Medicare doesnt cover, like copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles.\nIf you have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, there is a disenrollment period from January 1 to February 14 each year, should you decide youd like to return to Original Medicare and stop paying for Medicare Advantage.\nOkay, that was a lot. Here are the dates you need to know for Medicare enrollment:\n"}
