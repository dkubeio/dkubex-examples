There are new terms to learn, new enrollment periods, and four parts of coverage where there used to be one. Understanding Medicare isnt always an easy task. So, lets start at the beginning.\n\nWhat is Medicare?\nMedicare is a government health insurance program run by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal government agency. In addition to covering the medical needs of Americans over age 65, Medicare also serves some younger people with disabilities, as well as dialysis patients.\n\nThe Parts of Medicare\nMedicare is comprised of four different partsA, B, C and D. Medicare Parts A and B are sometimes referred to as Original Medicare, which is managed by the federal government.\nParts A and B are provided to you through the Federal government. You can enroll in coverage during a seven-month window around your 65th birthday. Parts C and D are managed by private insurance companies that contract with Medicare to provide Parts A and B benefits. (We told you things would get interesting!)\nWhen you enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan, all your Medicare services are covered through Advantage plan rather than Original Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans also offer prescription drug coverage. Which brings us to\nWhy Choose Part C over original Medicare?\nSome Medicare Advantage Plans do offer coverage for vision, dental, and hearing, which arent offered under Original Medicare. Depending on the carrier and the plan, Advantage plans may have lower costs than the equivalent services under Original Medicare. But the most important part to note is that having just Medicare Part A and B leaves you with large deductibles and unlimited copays for doctor visits, x-rays, etc. Medicare Advantage plans put a cap on out-of-pocket expenses, limiting your exposure to high medical bills.\n\nEligibility\nYou can purchase a Medicare plan if you are 65 or older, if youre younger and receive certain social security benefits for a disability, or if you have end-stage renal disease, a type of permanent kidney failure that requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. If you receive social security benefits, then youll automatically be enrolled in Medicare as soon as youre eligible. If you dont already receive social security benefits, three months before you celebrate your 65th birthday, you can apply for Part A and Part B. You may opt out of your Part B coverage if you wish. If you decide to enroll later, however, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty.\nUnder some circumstances, spouses, ex-spouses, widows and widowers, or other family members may be eligible for Medicare, even if you arent.\n\nWhat does it cost?\nPatients on Original Medicare (Parts A and B) can easily be deceived by their small monthly premiums. While its true that, generally, Medicare provides a lot of coverage for a much lower price than youd get with any other insurance plan, there are a couple of plan features that can make Original Medicare financially devastating.\nPatients on Medicare usually pay a 20 percent coinsurance for medical services. For a $200 doctors appointment, the bill wouldnt be so bad at $40. But that 20 percent also applies to things like x-rays, colonoscopies, chemotherapy,and emergency room visits. Those services cost thousands of dollars, so that 20 percent starts to balloon very quickly. For example, lets say you spend a night in the hospital, have some tests run and leave with a $10,000 bill. Youre now responsible for $2,000 of that. And unlike the health insurance youve been used to carrying, there is no out-of-pocket maximum. So that means theres no cap on the exposure you face. This is where Medicare Advantage comes in. You can choose from a variety of options that can not only lower your coinsurance but will also limit your out-of-pocket expenses.\nAs you can see, selecting the best Medicare parts is an important decision for your health and your bank account.
