You can shop between November 1, 2016 andJanuary 31, 2017.Even if you love your current plan, heres why it still makes sense to explore your options for 2017:\nAnd remember, dont shop by monthly premium alone. A health insurance plan that has a $100 monthly premium may look like the lowest cost plan, but after factoring in deductible, copays/coinsurance,and prescription costs, that same plan could end up costing more than one with a $200 monthly premium and higher levels of coverage.\nIf you have any questions or need help determining which health insurance plan is the best fit for you next year, give us a call at (866) 602-8466.
