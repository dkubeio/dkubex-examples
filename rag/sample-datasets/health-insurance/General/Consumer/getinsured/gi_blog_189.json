So, when AIS, which is one of the most authoritative sources on the industry, finally released their 2016 Directory of Health Plans, we were very excited to see what the numbers would reveal.\nBefore we dig into the findings, a note about the data. This years report was delayed so that the data compiled is through January 1, 2016. In prior releases, the reporting dates varied because the survey was compiled between October and December. A consequence of this change is that the report is now published in June instead of April. This change, however, is a positive one as it will result in more consistent and likely more accurate reporting.\nTwo key trends stood out this year.\nAt a high level, the AIS data shows that total membership in health plans increased 1.6 percent from 294 million to 299 million between 2015 and 2016. This is double the population growth rate of 0.8 percent, which indicates that more Americans are getting health insurance coverage as a percentage of the population. This data is not surprising given the increase in the number of covered Americans as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nCommercial plan membership declined from 89 million to 88 million. This was driven by a drop in commercial risk membership from 64 to 62 million. One might think that this was compensated for by increased ASO/Self-Funded business. However, membership was flat at 117 million. Overall this indicates a shift away from group coverage to individual plan membership. This trend may accelerate in future years as members with group coverage migrate to individual plans.\nThe House of Representatives just passed the Small Business Health Care Relief Act. This legislation would remove penalties from small businesses that currently prevent employers from reimbursing employees on a pre-tax basis for individual health premiums. If the bill becomes law, it would likely accelerate the group-to-individual coverage migration.\nIn parallel with the decline in commercial coverage, there was a drop in the number of plans offering commercial risk products from 236 in 2015 to 223 in 2016. Much of this was due to the demise of ACA Co-ops that were hit hard by underfunding of the risk corridor adjustments in the fall of 2015. The AIS data supports what we have been seeing in the market this past year.\n"}
