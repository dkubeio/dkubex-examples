Along with all the things that autumn brings (pumpkin-flavored everything, the leaves changing color, bearable temperatures) there are a few we can certainly do without, like the flu, allergies, and head colds. A few measures of prevention can go a long way in keeping you and your family healthy this fall.\nPreventing the flu\nFlu season runs from October through May, peaking between December and February. The CDC recommends that everyone over 6 months old should get a flu vaccine, especially high-risk individuals (children under 5, adults 65 and older, pregnant women, people with certain medical conditions, and residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities). The vaccine takes about two weeks to kick in, so if you plan on getting a flu shot, late September is the perfect time to do it.\nWhat else?\nSchool-borne illnesses\nColds that children pick up at school affect more than just their direct families because even if you dont have children, you likely know people who do.

Friend, family or coworker, youll probably encounter an adult in the near future who got sick from a child. So, basically, were all in this together.\nWhat are we to do? Take the usual precautions to avoid getting sick and set a good example for the wee ones:\nSeasonal allergies\nStruggling with seasonal allergies can certainly take a lot of the fun out of the changing seasons. In addition to over-the-counter remedies and prescriptions, there are non-medicinal ways to help yourself breathe a little easier.\nStay healthy out there.\n"}
