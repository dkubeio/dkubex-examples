There have been a lot of rumblings in the media about large health insurance premium increases for 2017. So, if youre wondering what your premiums are going to be for the upcoming year, and what you can do about it, lets take a look at some things you should know about the cost of health insurance.\nYes, may be premiums are increasing for some, but they went down first.\nFirst, its important to know that projected increases do not affect everyone, and are, on average, much smaller than you think. So the first thing youll want to do if you love your current plan, is to check with your carrier to see if your monthly premium will be rising so you know where your plan stands.\nIf we take a look back, well see that the increases we are experiencing, are all a matter of perspective. A study by Brookings found that when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched in 2014, premiums decreased between 10  21 percent across the board from what they were in 2013, while increasing enrollees benefits. That means that even though premiums have gone up over the past two years, theyre still lower, on average, than what they would have been absent the ACA, and youre still getting more for your money. In fact, Affordable Care Act premiums would have to increase approximately 44 percent this year just for prices to catch up with the trajectory we were on prior to the ACA.*\nYoure still likely saving money.\nUnder the ACA, health insurance plans are required to provide more comprehensive cover than they did in the past. So with todays plans, youre getting more for your money. For example, its estimated that the average annual healthcare spend for a plan that covered 60 percent of healthcare expenses was $3,480 in 2009. The same premium in 2014 for the second-lowest-cost silver plan was about $3,800. Yes, this is a 9 percent increase, but a silver plan covers 70 percent of expenses, the ACA silver plan a more affordable and valuable option.*\nShop around during open enrollment to find the best premium.\nSome carriers (UnitedHealthcare, Humana and Aetna to name the larger players) have dropped out of the marketplace, so for some shopping around isnt an option, its a necessity. But even if your plan is still around for 2017, you should make sure it still works for you. Youll want to check to see if your premium and deductibles have changed and whether your doctors and prescriptions are still covered in your network.\nNew plans are introduced each year as well, giving you another reason to see whats being offered for 2017. If your premium has gone up, theres a good chance that there may be a different plan from another carrier that suits your needs just as well, and will cost you less. Comparing plans doesnt take a lot of time and could be well worth it in the end.\nThe tax penalty.\nIf you choose to remain uninsured, you may have to pay a tax penalty when you file your taxes. The fee is calculated in two different ways: (1) as a percentage of your household income or (2) a per-person penalty. Youll pay whichever of the two is higher. In 2016 the penalty was either 2.5 percent of household income, or $695 per uninsured adult and $347.50 per child under 18, with a maximum fee of $2,085. The penalty for 2017 hasnt been announced just yet, but its set to increase with inflation.\nIf you have questions or need help at any point during the enrollment season, our licensed agents are ready to help you find a new plan for 2017.
