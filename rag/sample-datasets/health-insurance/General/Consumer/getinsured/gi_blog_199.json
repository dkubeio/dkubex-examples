This represents an important chapter in a larger story about the massive shift occurring across our healthcare system  the move away from traditional fee-for-service to value-based care. The payer-provider convergence comes in many shapes and sizes, ranging from M&A and joint ventures to strategic and contractual alliances. While the level of integration ranges widely in these various scenarios, the traditional definitions, economics, and roles and responsibilities of payers and providers are changing. The provider-sponsored plan (PSP) is on the rise, and many argue that it is a good thing.\nWhat exactly is a provider-sponsored plan?\nA provider-sponsored plan is a health insurance company owned by a health system, physicians group, or hospital. There are many ways to describe the concept of providers getting into the health insurance game. McKinsey and Company uses the term provider-led health plan and Deloitte prefers provider-sponsored plan. We are seeing our customers coalesce around provider-sponsored plan and the accompanying initialismPSP.\nHow many PSPs are there in the U.S.?\nAccording to the preliminary results from Atlantic Information Services (AIS) annual survey for its forthcoming Directory of Health Plans: 2016 there were 270 provider-sponsor plans that participated in government and commercial markets in 2015, up from 107 two years ago. PSP membership increased from 32.8 million in 2014 to 36.2 million in 2015, an increase of 10% in just one year.\nAre PSPs a new trend?\nProviders getting into the insurance business is not new  there are established, successful IDNs (e.g. Kaiser, Intermountain, Geisinger) that have been around for decades and have proven the model. There were also a cohort of PSPs that emerged in the 90s, but didnt survive because offinancial difficulties and their inability toachieve scale.\nSo whats changed and why are so many health systems interested in the health insurance business today? The post-ACAworld is a much different place than the 90s when the lastPSP surge occurred. Some important changes include:\nIn todays market, PSPs are showing that greater integration can improve the quality of the care, and reduce costs, while still providing a great experience to members and patients.\nPSPs are well positioned\nThe reason so many providers are becoming payers (or at least considering it) is because PSPs, as Mitch Morris at Deloitte put it, have at their fingertips the very levers that are needed to be successful in the post-transformation world. This makes PSPs one of the most exciting areas of the health insurance ecosystem right now. PSPs have many assets that they can leverage: quick and reliable access to claims and clinical data, strong brands and customer loyalty, and an ability to innovate relatively quickly. They have the advantage of not being encumbered by old technology and are free to pursue and implement first-class technology to help them meet their goals of providing a superior customer experience for their members.\nDespite the many advantages of PSPs, there are of course challenges. To be successful in the long run, PSPs will need to:\nPrivate exchanges, which are e-commerce platforms for health insurance, are perfectly suited to help PSPs meet these five objectives. My next post will discuss how adopting an e-commerce approach will help PSPs achieve their full potential.\n"}
