The bulk of emergency room visits do happen over the summer months thanks to Fourth of July fireworks, bug bites,and allergic reactions, and water-borne illnesses. If youre currently without health insurance, you still have coverage options; a summertime illness doesnt have to be the end of your fun!\nSpecial enrollment periods\nIf you experience a qualifying life event like getting married, having a baby, or moving, youre eligible for a special enrollment period. That means a 60-day window opens in which you can enroll in a major medical plan. Not anticipating any change this summer?

But waitdidnt the Affordable Care Act (ACA) get rid of pre-existing condition restrictions? For many major medical plans, yes. But under the law, short-term plans are still permitted to not cover costs related to pre-existing conditions and can also deny coverage altogether for theseconditions.\nShort-term medicalplans also dont provide the same level of coverage as major medical (and they dont exclude you from potentially having to pay a tax penalty), but they can be less expensive than major medical premiums and do provide you with a level of coverage that can certainly be helpful if you find yourself needing a doctor or ER visit this summer.\nAccident medical expense\nAccident prone? No worries. If you have an accident medical expense (AME) plan, unexpected medical expenses are covered. These plans are super flexible: you select the level of coverage youd like with tiers ranging from $2,500 to $10,000; you can choose any effective date, including immediate coverage (which begins midnight of the following day); and you can cancel at any time. AME is also simpleyoure covered up to the threshold you select with one deductible (in most cases $100).\nStill have questions?
