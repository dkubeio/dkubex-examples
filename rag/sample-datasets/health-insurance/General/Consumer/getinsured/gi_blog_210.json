Jess and he worked together previously when Chris was an HHS Entreprenuer, and built MAGI-in-the-Cloud, a SaaS solution for states to determine Medicaid eligibility.\nShe asked Chris (among other things) to bring new vendors into the spaceparticularly Silicon Valley companies that specialize in specific health care Enterprise disciplines. The rate of innovation in the Medicaid Enterprise has lagged behind the consumer space. The big impediment for specialized vendors is the large, monolithic nature of current Medicaid RFPs, but that is not the only challenge. Many Medicaid RFPs are prescriptive: describing a solution rather than the problem. And the procurement process itself is expensive and time-consuming. That overhead makes it challenging for states to break the Medicaid Enterprise into smaller parts.\nThe National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) has put out a serious set of recommendations for ways to improve this process.Inspired, Chris created his own farcical list offering a countering view: what not to do. He presented this list at the State Health IT Connect Conference 2016 in Baltimore:\nTop 10 RFP Requirements Guaranteed To Annoy Vendors\n10.
