Probably not. After losing millions of dollars on the public exchanges, many health insurers are now reconsidering that particular sales channel. So what options do health insurers have? One attractive option is to shift Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) from public to insurer-led private exchanges, which will strengthen their position in the individual market.\nDuring our webinar on March 30, we will talk with industry leaders at Independence Blue Cross and GetInsured to hear what theyve learned over the past three years and why its time for health insurers to rethink how they market their QHPs. Listen to theexperts talk about trends they have witnessed and how they have adapted to changing realities by registering here for the webinar.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) continues to drive change and disruption and its full impact keeps evolving year to year. Especially in the individual health plan market, many insurers have suffered debilitating financial losses, while others are adapting in ways that enable them to fare better.\nThe health insurance market, especially for individual health plans, will likelybe tumultuous for some time, but insurers still have a tremendous opportunity for growth. As the impacts of the ACA unfold, insurers can move decisively to implement e-commerce sales and marketing approaches that improve target marketing and member-for-life engagement. With insurer-led private exchanges, insurers can shift sales of QHPs away from the public exchanges and strengthen their position in the individual market.\nThe following industry leaders will share their insights during the Why Its Time to Rethink Marketing for Individual Health Plans webinar on March 30:\nThe webinar begins at 2PM ET/ 11AM PST. Looking forward to your participation!\n"}
