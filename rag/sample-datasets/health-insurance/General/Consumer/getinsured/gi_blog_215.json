They tend to be digital natives who are unfamiliar with health insurance terminology and who like to comparison shop before buying anything. They are a vocal bunch who turn to social media to voice their opinions.\nMillennials also make up the largest proportion of the U.S. labor force today, and it is expected they will be half the workforce in 2020 and 75 percent of the workforce in 10 years. They are a group that insurers and employers cant afford to ignore.\nBuying health insurance is clearly not the same as buying a plane ticket online. But e-commerce principles that were pioneered for everything from plane tickets to music are becoming the standard for choosing and buying things, and are therefore essential for the healthcare and health insurance industries to embrace.\nJournalists, analysts and health insurance experts ask what will be the TurboTax of healthcare. While the TurboTax analogy may not be 100 percent applicable to health insurance, insurers do need to take an e-commerce approach in order to gain and retain members, particularly younger ones.\nMillennials, who spend most of their day in front of an electronic device, will especially appreciate the similarities between a private exchange and their favorite e-commerce sites. When designing a private exchange, here are four things insurers, brokers and employers need to keep in mind into order to attract and retain this distinct group:\nUnderstanding what attracts and retains millennial customers is half the battle. The bigger challenge is executing on that knowledge. We believe insurers can meet the demands of millennials through a well-designed health insurance e-commerce platform or private exchange. These insurer-led exchanges allow employers and insurers to adapt to the needs of millennials, provide shopping, choice, instant access, and education tools. Millennials purchasing health insurance need to be treated like consumers of other retail products, and a well-designed private exchange can make that a reality.\nMillennials are no longer the future  they are the here and now, and much of what they want is aligned with the wishes of Gen Xers and Baby Boomers. Health insurers, employers, and brokers need to get on the millennial bandwagon or be left out in the cold.\n"}
