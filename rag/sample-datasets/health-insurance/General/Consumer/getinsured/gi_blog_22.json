Up to fifteen million people could lose health insurance coverage over the next twelve months.

S\ntate-based exchanges (SBEs) can, and will, and are playing a critical role in managing the churn between ACA health insurance and Medicaid, and vice versa. Some of the ways SBEs can help include:\n\nOutreach and Education:\n State-based exchanges can help to educate individuals who are transitioning between Medicaid and ACA health insurance plans. They can provide information about the benefits and costs of each type of plan, eligibility criteria, and enrollment periods. By providing this information, state-based exchanges can help to reduce confusion and ensure that individuals are aware of their options.\n\nSeamless Enrollment:\n State-based exchanges can implement seamless enrollment processes that allow individuals to transition between Medicaid and ACA health insurance plans without experiencing gaps in coverage. This can be achieved by designing rules that allow for backdated coverage.\n\nCoordinated Eligibility Determination\n: State-based exchanges can work closely with state Medicaid agencies to ensure that eligibility determinations are tightly coordinated and streamlined. This can help to reduce the administrative burden on individuals and ensure that they are enrolled in the appropriate plan based on their eligibility status.\n\nData Sharing:\n State-based exchanges can facilitate data sharing between Medicaid and ACA health insurance plans. This can help to ensure that individuals receive appropriate care and services regardless of their insurance status. For example, data sharing can help to ensure that individuals who are transitioning from Medicaid to ACA health insurance plans continue to receive necessary medical services without interruption.\n\nEffectively executing the Medicaid unwind will take a village. By implementing outreach and education efforts, seamless enrollment processes, coordinated eligibility determination, and data sharing initiatives, state-based exchanges can help to ensure that individuals receive the care and services they need without interruption.\nEffectively executing the Medicaid unwind will take a village.
