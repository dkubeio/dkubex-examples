According to Pew Research, Today nearly two-thirds of Americans own a smartphone, and 19% of Americans rely to some degree on a smartphone for accessing online services and information and for staying connected to the world around them  either because they lack broadband at home, or because they have few options for online access other than their cell phone. As the graphic highlights, a significant segment of the population has no other option for accessing the Internet. Although it previously appeared that mobility was concentrated among millennials, recent data shows that for the first time in 2014, mobile Internet use surpassed desktop use across the board.\n\nAt GetInsured, we see this trend as extremely important for health insurers.

Depending on the device, the features and process flow adapt to best suit the device for an optimal consumer experience. In addition, insurers have the opportunity to present a seamless flow from a digital channel to speaking by phone with a customer service representative and back again.\nAs health insurers embrace e-commerce through their private exchange, there are six key success factors to consider.\n"}
