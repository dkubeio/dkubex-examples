For insurers and employers alike, understanding these preferences and tailoring their offerings are imperative to enticing millennials to enroll.\nMillennials are:\nMillennial habits, likes and dislikes are all well documented and understood, and are viewed by many as powerful drivers for change. What worked for earlier generations is not speaking to millennials. Less than half of all eligible employees under age 26 enrolled in an employer-provided health plan in 2015, according to a recent report from the ADP Research Institute. Today, 83 percent of employees under 26 are eligible for health insurance at work, up 8.5 percent from five years ago. Yet, fewer enroll. In 2011, almost 57 percent of young millennials who were eligible for employer-subsidized health coverage took it. This year, only 44 percent did.\nSo what is going on? One reason for these low enrollment numbers is that millennials want their health insurance experience to be akin to online banking, purchasing shoes from Zappos and acting on social media recommendations. They want real-time information, lots of choice and the ability to compare prices. Private exchanges can help health insurers create the e-commerce experience millennials expect  one that is easy to use, available 24/7 and gives them the information they need to make the right decision.\nE-commerce principles that were pioneered elsewhere are now becoming intrinsic to the healthcare and health insurance industries. Insurers need to do more than simply keep pace; they need to lead in the market in order to gain and retain members, particularly younger ones.\n"}
