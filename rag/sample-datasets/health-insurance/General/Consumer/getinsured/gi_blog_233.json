Over the past year weve seen a surge in provider sponsored plans (PSPs) moving forward aggressively in their e-commerce approaches. Deloitte has just published an excellent analysis that reinforces this observation: PSPs  defined as health plans that are financially sponsored by a provider (hospital, physician group, health system)  are generating significant momentum in the market.\nThe Deloitte report emphasizes several trends Array is also seeing. PSPs are in an ideal position to succeed in the individual market due to their strong brands and ability to integrate care financing with care delivery. PSPs can also complement delivery system investments in ACO strategies.\nThe Deloitte study offers some important new insights based on a regression analysis of PSPs financial and market metrics.\nDeloittes analysis concludes that PSPs recent successful performance is evidence of their emergence as a potentially disruptive industry innovator. From an Array perspective, the proactive way that PSPs are approaching private exchanges as part of e-commerce strategies shows their potential may very soon turn into reality.
