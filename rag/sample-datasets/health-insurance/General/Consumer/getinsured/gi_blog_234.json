Today, according to the Kaiser Family Foundations 2015 Employer Health Benefits Survey almost one quarter do. In parallel, private health insurance exchanges, which doubled enrollment figures from 2014 to 2015, are widely expected to grow to 40 million by 2018. Up until recently, these two new ways of purchasing health insurance and interacting with health insurers appeared to be separate trends. But new opportunities for growth are emerging for insurers through a combination of high-deductible health plans and an insurer-led private exchange. It is expected that avoidance of the Cadillac Tax will accelerate the shift toward private exchanges and high-deductible plans as employers seek to give more benefit options while reducing their benefit contributions.\nNot only do studies show that those who enroll in health insurance through a private exchange are more likely to pick a HSA-qualified plans, but there is also strong evidence to show HDHPs are a stepping stone to additional sales of voluntary products.\n"}
