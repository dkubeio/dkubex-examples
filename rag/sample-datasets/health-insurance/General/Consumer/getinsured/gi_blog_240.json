More importantly, it lets insurers provide the easy and intuitive shopping, enrollment, and ongoing service experience required to help individuals confidently select and manage their insurance plans and payments. Whats more, it positions insurers to seamlessly manage a member if they change job status, resulting in a transition between individual insurance and group-based coverage.
