Choosing a policy based on the monthly premium alone might not get you the best coverage for your money, or the best deal. Its important to also weigh your medical needs against things like copays, coinsurance, and deductibles  examples of how an insurance company shares the cost of coverage with you  as well as provider network.\nA plans Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) describes howcopays,coinsurance, anddeductiblesapply to each type of covered service.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires all policies sold on the exchange  as well as many employer plans  to explain plan benefits in detail in a Summary of Benefits brochure that meets certain federal guidelines. (A few types of policies, including stand-alone dental and vision, are exempt from this requirement.) Reading the descriptions of whats covered and how its covered makes it easier to comparison-shop policies before you enroll. And it gives you something to refer to if you have questions.\nFor example, lets say youve got a pre-existing condition likediabetes, so you know youll be visiting the doctor often and taking prescription drugs every day. If one of the plans youre considering has a slightly higher premium but covers your regular medication and requires just a small copay  and includes your family doctor in its network  youll actually save a ton of money in the long run.\nOr, if theres a particular service you think youll need, you can look at the Summary of Benefits for different plans and compare. For instance, if youre trying to have a baby and considering infertility treatment, or you usually get regular chiropractic care to keep your back feeling good, youll want to check the Summary of Benefits of the plans youre looking into to see if those services are covered. (Youll also want to check the list of approved providers to make sure the infertility doctor youve heard good things about, or your favorite chiropractor, is in-network.)\nThe ACA requires the Summary of Benefits information to be available during any enrollment period. Carriers must notify policyholders of any changes in writing, at least 60 days in advance. Anytime you renew a plan, you should receive a new summary.\n"}
