This is your provider network. All providers and facilities on your plans list are considered in-network. Those not included on the list are considered out-of-network.\nHealth insurance companies want you to stay in-network for two reasons:\nNo one likes surprises, especially in the form of huge medical bills. Thats why its so important to make sure any medical care you receive comes from a doctor or facility thats part of your network.\nStaying in-network helps you avoid unexpected charges since providers must accept their agreed-upon rate, including any payment from you, as payment in full. They arent allowed to charge any additional fees  a practice calledbalanced billing or theyll be in violation of their contract with your health insurance company.\nMost of your covered medical expenses will get billed directly to your insurer, and once youve met your deductible, youll only be responsible for acopayor the agreed-upon amount ofcoinsuranceuntil you reach yourout-of-pocket max.\nNow, out-of-network providers are a different story. Theyre likely to send a bill for the entire cost of your care. Some may even require you to pay their entire fee up front before filing a claim with your insurance company. (In those cases you may only be reimbursed for a portion of the cost. Often, youll be on the hook for the entire amount.) Since out-of-network providers dont have to stick to negotiated rates, their fees can be astronomical.\n1. Youll be much happier (i.e., youll hang on to more of your hard-earned dollars) if your healthcare comes from in-network providers.When youre choosing an insurance plan, check to see if your favorite doctors are in the plans network. And dont just look at the list on a providers website; call each doctors office and ask if they take the specific plan youre considering. (Doctors may accept some plans from a carrier but not others.) Keep in mind that networks change all the time. Its a good idea to double-check your doctors network status before each visit to avoid being hit with unexpected out-of-network charges.\n2. Most HMOs and many EPOs wont accept any out-of-network claims for routine and non-emergency care.Even less-restrictive plans will sometimes reject an out-of-network claim or ask you to pay a significantly higher portion of the bill. In some states, an out-of-network provider can charge you whatever they choose, no matter what your health insurance company says is a reasonable and customary fee for that service.\n3. In a true medical emergency, you can go to the emergency room without worrying about excessive out-of-network bills.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) guarantees your right to emergency care, even if its at an out-of-network hospital, without prior approval from your insurance carrier. You cant be charged higher copays or coinsurance either. This is one of the10 essential benefitscovered by the ACA. Once youre stable, youll be transferred to an in-network facility. (From that point on youll need to make sure all your providers are in-network. Even though this is not the sort of thing you want to worry about when youre ill or injured, you really dont want to be hit with a hefty bill for your care down the road.)\n"}
