And also on what type of health plan you have.\nSome plans charge just a small fee, known as acopay, for doctors visits. With others, your insurance company will pay a percentage of the cost once youve met yourdeductible, an arrangement known ascoinsurance. Still other types of plans use a combination of copays and coinsurance to share the costs.\nRead through your plan benefits carefully so you understand exactly how your insurer handles trips to the doctor (and what payments are expected of you). Heres how many plans typically deal with cost-sharing for different types of office visits.\nPreventive Services Visit:There is no charge for an office visit when you see your in-network primary care physician (PCP) for a flu vaccine, blood pressure check, an annual physical (for women and children), or any other services considered preventive care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). You might get a bill if your doctor orders additional tests or performs other services  but covered preventive visits are free.\nPrimary Care Visit:If, for example, you go to your PCP for a nagging cough, an unusual rash, or any other fairly routine matter about your overall health, some plans charge you a small copay. With others (including most bronze plans), youll have to pay the full cost of all visits until you reach your deductible. As always, be sure to check with your insurance company to see how these kinds of office visits are covered.\nSpecialist Visits:While your primary care doctor performs routine checkups and is generally the overseer of your healthcare, a specialty doctor  or specialist  addresses particular types of illness or specific parts of your body. If, for instance, you come down with a urinary tract infection, you may need to see a urologist. Or if your bad back starts acting up, you may want to see an orthopedic specialist.\nPlans with copays often charge a slightly higher fee when you see a specialist; some plans (HMOs and EPOs) require a referral from your primary care doctor before seeing a specialist, even if the specialist is in your network.\nWith other plans it works the same as for a visit to your primary care doctor: You may have to pay the entire cost of all doctor visits until you reach your deductible before your coinsurance kicks in (and your insurer starts sharing your healthcare costs).\nOther Provider Visits: Some plans offer limited coverage for services from other types of specialists who arent MDs: chiropractors, physical therapists, registered dietitians, even alternative and complementary practitioners such as acupuncturists. If your plan does include these benefits, make sure you check to see how many visits are allowed and how much the plan will pay.\nOffice visit fees may vary among plans, but dont focus too much on those numbers beyond whether you have to meet your deductible before your insurance kicks in. Its usually more important to consider the overall costs of your healthcare when comparing and choosing a plan. Then take a look at themetal tiersto better understand the levels of coverage offered under the ACA.\n"}
