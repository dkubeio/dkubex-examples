And most likely youll pay a fixed fee for your visit. This is your copay.\nThink about it as your share of the cost for the providers attention, the questions he or she asks, the physical examination, and advice given. As long as your visit doesnt include additional tests or services, thats all youll pay. Your insurance carrier will pick up the rest.\nIf you currently have health insurance, take a look at your insurance card  the copay amount is often displayed. If youre shopping for insurance, take a look at the plan tiles, and youll see that copays are featured pretty prominently.\nThese dollar amounts will become very familiar throughout the year, because every time you see your healthcare provider or specialist, these copays are what youll be expected to pay  usually right there on the spot.\nThe good news is that in many cases, the copay is the only amount youll pay for the medical care you need.\nAlways double-check when youre asked for a copay.Under the new healthcare law, certainpreventive servicesare 100 percent covered, so you shouldnt have a copay for those. However, some providers are not up to speed on the new rules and are mistakenly asking for copays for every visit. As a savvy consumer, youll know which services are considered preventive and dont require a copay, as long as youre seeing a provider in your network.\nYou might be able to get help paying your copays.If you qualify, the federal government might cover some or all of your copay cost  through whats calledcost-sharing reductions. To take advantage of your cost-sharing reduction, youd have to buy asilver tier plan. Be sure tocheck your eligibility for cost-sharing reductionsbefore you shop for insurance.\n(Also: Check to see if you qualify forMedicaidorCHIP for your kids, other ways to get insurance thats affordable or even free, with small or no copays on anything.)\nSome plans use deductibles and coinsurance in place of copays (sadly, this doesnt mean that all your visits are free).If you see a plan with a percentage (rather than a dollar amount) for office visits and prescription drugs, it means your insurance carrier probably wont start helping you pay for your medical care until youve hit your deductible  unless its preventive care. The benefit of this type of plan is that its likely to have a much lower monthly premium. If you dont have a pre-existing medical condition and you dont anticipate using much medical care during the year, this type of plan might be worth considering.\nCopays usually apply only to in-network healthcare providers.If youve got a plan with copays, it means your insurance carrier has made an agreement with all the healthcare providers in yournetworkand theyve worked out how much everything costs and how much everyone pays. As long as you stay in-network, your copay will be what you expect. If you go outside your network, you wont know how much it will cost (but itll most likely cost more).\nA copay doesnt cover tests or supplies.Lets say you cut your finger while chopping veggies so you go to an urgent care clinic. You see a nurse practitioner who gives you a few stitches and sends you on your way. In this case, your copay will cover the nurses time. But your copay may not cover the thread used for the stitches, so you could get a bill for that later.\nSome other examples of services that you may be charged for in addition to the copay: a throat swab (for strep) if you see your doctor for a sore throat; blood work; an ultrasound or X-ray to check for a broken bone  you get the idea.\nDifferent services have different copay amounts.Depending on the plan you choose, youll probably have one copay for office visits, another for emergency room visits, yet another for urgent care clinics, and maybe a different copay when you see a specialist. You might also have different copay amounts for brand-name prescriptions vs. generics, or for different tiers of medications. When youre comparing plans, be sure to look at all the different copays and consider which types of services youre most likely to use through the year.
