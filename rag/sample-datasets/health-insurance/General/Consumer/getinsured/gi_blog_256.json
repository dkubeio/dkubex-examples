Preventive healthcare can allow your doctor to spot potential issues before you dont feel well.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires qualified health plans to cover certain services aimed at keeping you healthy. Whats more, these services must be offered at no cost, meaning you wont be charged a copay or coinsurance even if you havent met your deductible.\nAll marketplace plans must cover certain preventive services.And theyre free of charge, as long as you use an in-network provider.\nTaking advantage of no-cost preventive care is a smart idea. It can help you and your doctor spot potential medical issues (hopefully before they become a big deal) or treat a condition before it blows up into something major. Chances are, in the long run youll not only feel better, youll save some cash on healthcare.\nNot all plans are required to cover preventive services.If your plan is not a qualified health plan, you may be charged for preventive care and you may not be entitled to some services. Employer plans that are grandfathered often charge for many preventive benefits. Short-term medical and accident plans usually dont include any cost-free preventive services. However, any plan you buy on a federal or state marketplace (or with a government-approved partner like GetInsured) will include free preventive care.\nYou must use an in-network provider or you could get hit with a big bill.If you go to an out of-network doctor or provider for your preventive services, youll probably be charged for the cost of the visit as well as the service, even if its on the list of covered benefits.\nEven if you stay in-network, theres a chance you might receive a bill if your provider orders additional tests beyond the covered preventive benefits. Youll also be charged if the primary reason for your visit was not preventive care.\n"}
