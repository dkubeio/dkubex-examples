Now youre covered, right?\nMaybe, maybe not.\nYour health insurance coverage start datealso called your plans effective dateis the day your insurance company will begin helping to pay for your medical expenses. Before that date, they wont. In most cases, your effective date isnt immediate. In fact, depending on when you sign up for health insurance, your effective date could be more than a month away. The day your health insurance goes into effect depends on which half of the month you buy your plan.\nHeres a simple explanation of how coverage start dates work in most states.\nDuring an open enrollment period:\nFor example, if you bought a plan on January 3, 2015, youd be covered starting February 1, 2015. If you bought a plan on January 16, your effective date would be March 1, 2015.\nIf you qualify for aspecial enrollment periodoutside of open enrollment, the effective dates generally work the same way.After open enrollment ends, you can still buy health insurance if you have aqualifying event, a change of life circumstances such as a divorce or a move to another state. So if you buy a plan on May 1, expect your coverage to start on June 1. If you buy your plan on May 16 (or any time after the 15th of the month), your coverage start date most likely wont be until July 1.\nYup. You guessed it. There are a couple of exceptions here, too.\nRemember, for your coverage start date to take effect, youll need to do two things: Complete your enrollment form and pay your first months premium. Only after youve done bothenrolled and made your first paymentwill your insurance kick in. Its never a bad idea to call your insurance company just to be sure everything is in order, and to confirm the day your coverage will go into effect.\n"}
