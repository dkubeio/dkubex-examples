However, some situations, called exemptions, will excuse you from paying this penalty.\nThere are many reasons why you might be eligible for an exemption. One example: Buying health insurance means you wont have enough money left over to pay for basic needs like food, shelter, and transportation. Youll be granted an exemption if the lowest-priced coverage available to you would cost more than 8 percent of your household income.\nThere are a number of ways you might qualify for an exemption.Besides health insurance being too costly, circumstances such as recent homelessness, bankruptcy, a death in the family, or the unexpected financial burden of caring for an ill or aging family membercalled hardship exemptionscould make you eligible. You might also be allowed an exemption if your state did not expand its Medicaid program, and your income is too high to qualify you for either Medicaid or tax credits.\nKeep in mind that although your circumstances may be among those listed as qualifying you for an exemption, youre not guaranteed approval.Each exemption has a different filing process and requires different paperwork. You can apply for most exemptions when you file your federal tax return. For certain types of exemptions youll be able to file through a federal or state marketplace.\nInstructions to help you fill out an application for many exemptions can be foundhere.\nIf you live in a state that runs its own marketplace, it may handle exemptions differently from the federal exchange.The federal government has created guidelines to help states decide who is eligible for a hardship exemption, but states may create their own set of rules, use different forms, or have a slightly different approval process. Be sure to check your states hardship exemption requirements carefully to see whether or not you qualify, and exactly how to apply.\nThe length of your exemption can vary, depending on your situation.For example, if buying health insurance is deemed unaffordable at the present time, you wont have to worry about paying a penalty until your finances improve, or an affordable plan becomes available.\nIf youre granted a hardship exemption, you might want to consider buying catastrophic coverage.If a life hardship exempts you from the penalty for not having traditional (major medical) health insurance, you might want to considercatastrophic coverageto protect you and your family in the event of an accident or serious illness. Typically, catastrophic plans are only available to people under age 30, but youll be able to apply for one if youre granted a hardship exemption.\nBecause there are higher healthcare costs up front with these plans, and they dont cover most services until youve reached your deductible, they have lower premiums and, for some people, may be more affordable. And with catastrophic coverage, at least youll have some help paying for medical care should anyone in your family have unexpected, and costly, medical bills.\nIf you think your exemption will be for the short termless than a yearyou might also consider buying ashort-term health insurance policyto bridge the gap.\n"}
