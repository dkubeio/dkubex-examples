If youre required to buy health insurance and you dont buy it, youll have to pay a fine called the individual shared responsibility payment when you file your taxes.\nSome people areexempt from the mandate. If youre not exempt, you must purchase insurance or pay the fine.\nIf youre thinking about going without insurance (most likely to save money), you might want to know what your penalty will be before you decide. To get an estimate, use ourtax credit estimator.\nIf youre thinking about paying a penalty fee rather than buying health insurance, you may want to run the numbers. Do a little research and compare the cost of the penalty with the cost of health insurance in your area. In many cases, purchasing health coverage could cost the same, or even less, especially with tax credits. And then youve got something to show for your money in the event of an accident or unexpected illness.\nSome people wont have to pay the penalty.\nThose who have a very low income, belong to certain religious sects, or have recently experienced a hardship such as bankruptcy or domestic violence may beexempt from the requirement to have health insuranceand wont have to pay a penalty. If buying health coverage or paying the penalty would be a financial hardship, you also may qualify for ahardship waiver. (Note: There are specific rules regarding who qualifies for a hardship waiver.)\nIf youre not exempt, you will be subject to the penalty for not having health insurance. (In actuality, most people wont pay a penalty because they already have some type of health insurance that meets ACA requirements.)\nIf you owe a penalty, youll pay it when you file your taxes.The penalty will be assessed when you submit your tax return for the previous year. When you file your return, youll tell the government how much money you earned, whether or not you had health insurance, and whether you believe you qualify for an exemption. Theyll use this information to determine what, if any, penalty you owe.\nThere are two ways to pay the penalty if you owe one.\nIf the IRS determines youre someone who should have purchased health insurance and didnt, youll have to pay a fine.\nIf you owe a penalty, it may be prorated.\nEven if you have coverage for only part of the year, the amount of the fine is prorated based on your number of months without coverage. (Note: You may have to pay a penalty if you have more than one gap in coverage or if you arent covered for more than three months.)\nTheres a cap on the penalty.\nThe most the 2014 penalty can be is $2,448 for individuals and $12,240 for a family  the average cost of a bronze plan. This means that for most people its cheaper to buy health insurance than pay the penalty.\n"}
