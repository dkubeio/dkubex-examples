It was founded as a healthcare safety net for people who are no longer part of the workforce.\nBut Medicare isnt just for seniors. Younger people with certain disabilities, and those with end-stage renal disease  permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant  may also qualify for Medicare.\nThere are four parts to the Medicare program, and each one offers a different set of healthcare services and benefits.\nPart A (Hospital Insurance)\nThis part of Medicare helps cover your inpatient hospital stays, and offers some assistance for skilled nursing (e.g., a stay in a nursing home). It also helps cover hospice and at-home healthcare. You wont need to pay a premium for this coverage if you (or your spouse) paid Medicare taxes while you were working.\nIf youre eligible for Medicare Part A, youll likely be enrolled automatically three months before your 65th birthday assuming youve signed up for social security benefits. (If you plan to delay collecting social security but still want to enroll in Medicare, visit socialsecurity.gov or visit your local social security office for information about how to apply.) If you arent 65 but think you might be eligible for Medicare, visit Medicare.gov.\nPart B (Medical Insurance)\nPart B covers doctors services; outpatient services (including when you go to the hospital but dont have to stay overnight); diagnostic tests like X-rays; medical supplies; and preventive services like checkups, screenings, and vaccines. You pay a monthly premium for this coverage. Together, Part A and B are known as Original Medicare.\nPart C (typically referred to as Medicare Advantage)\nPart C plans provide Part A and B benefits as well as some additional coverage options: for example, dental, vision, hearing, and prescription medications. Unlike Original Medicare, which is administered by the government, Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurance companies that are contracted by the government. On occasion, they partner with an HMO or PPO to provide some of the services they cover.\nPart D (Prescription Drug Coverage)\nPart D Medicare plans provide prescription drug coverage. As with Medicare Advantage, Part D coverage is only offered through private insurance companies. You can buy a Part D prescription drug plan separately if you dont have drug coverage; for example, if you have Original Medicare. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription drug coverage, you wont need to buy a separate Part D plan.\n"}
