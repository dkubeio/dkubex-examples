But how generous will each plan be? What share of your health expenses will the insurance company cover, and what share will you have to pay out of your own pocket?\nTo get the answer, take a look at each plans metal tier.\nPlatinum plans are the most generous, then comes gold, then silver, then bronze.\n1. Find out if you qualify for government subsidies.If you qualify for financial help in the form ofcost-sharing reductions, you should consider buying a silver-tier plan. Why? Because you can only use cost-sharing reductions to help you pay for copays and coinsurance if youve got a silver plan. If youre not sure whether youre eligible for cost-sharing reductions to help you afford health insurance, do aquick estimate of your eligibilityhere on GetInsured, or call one of our brokers for help.\n2. Remember, lower premiums mean less generous plans.If youre tempted by low premiums, youre not alone. Getting health insurance for the lowest possible monthly price might feel like youre getting a bargain. Just remember that plans with lower premiums also usually have higher deductibles that youll have to meet, which means more out-of-pocket costs for you before your insurance kicks in. And vice versa  higher premium plans usually have lower deductibles. In other words, you may save now but end up paying more later.\n3. Keep in mind that the percentages arent exact.Weve just told you how much value each tier plan is supposed to provide, but you should know that the actual value you get might be lower (or higher).\nThats because the percentages are based on something called actuarial value  which means its an average. To get the actuarial value, an insurer takes the people who buy a particular type of plan and lumps them together. Then they lump together their healthcare costs. So for example, a platinum-tier insurance plan will pay about 90 percent of the healthcare costs for the whole group. Any one individual in the group might get more or less value from the plan.\n4.
