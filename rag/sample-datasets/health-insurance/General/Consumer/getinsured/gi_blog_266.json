You can see any doctor or provider within your network. You can also see providers outside your network, but it will cost you more. These plans offer you some flexibility.\nThe first thing youll notice about a PPO is thenetworksize. In general, there are more doctors, hospitals, specialists, and other providers in a PPO network than in an HMO or POS. This means youll have more providers to choose from when its time to get care.\nThe second thing to note is that you can get care from providers who arent in your network if you want. But out-of-network care will probably cost you more. If you choose an out-of-network doc, youll likely have to pay a higherdeductibleor highercoinsurance(or both).\nDont:Visit a provider (unless its an emergency) before confirming whether he or she is in your network.\nDo:Call before you go so you know whether a doctor or facility is in-network or out-of-network.\nWhy:Coverage for in-network providers can be a lot more generous than out-of-network coverage. You dont want to get surprised later. Know ahead of time whether your doc is in or out.\nDont:Call a provider and ask: Do you take [carrier name] insurance?\nDo:Call a provider and ask: Do you take [plan name] from [carrier name]?\nWhy:Your carrier has LOTS of plans. Some of those plans may include your doctor in the network. Some wont. Be specific. Ask about your particular plan.\nDont:Assume youll pay the samecopayno matter which provider you see.\nDo:Call ahead and ask.\nWhy:Copay amounts can vary for providers within your network. What you owe could be even higher if you see an out-of-network provider.\nDont:Get an expensive procedure or test without calling your carrier first.\nDo:Check to see whether preauthorization is required.\nWhy:Some procedures and tests (such as surgery, radiology tests, or hospitalization) have to be approved by the carrier beforehand. If you dont get preauthorization, you may get stuck paying the full cost yourself. Play it safe. Call your carrier before any major procedure or test to be sure its covered, and get preauthorization if you need it.\nDont:Assume PPO plans are the most expensive.\nDo:Comparison shop your options.\nWhy:Lots of different factors go into the price of a plan. Network size is one  generally, larger networks have higher premiums. And while its true that PPOs often have larger networks than HMO and POS plans, its not always the case. Dont short-change yourself by making assumptions about PPO cost relative to other plans. Check the details. And if you want help, contact a licensed broker for advice.\n"}
