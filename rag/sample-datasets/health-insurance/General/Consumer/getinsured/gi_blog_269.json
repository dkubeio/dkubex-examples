This is your monthly premium. You pay your premium directly to the health insurance company. (Note: With some plans, youll pay your premium every three months or just once a year.)\nYour premium isnt related to how much medical care you use. Its the fee you pay for having the plan. You have to pay your premiums on time for the entire year to keep your coverage active.\nWhen youre comparing health insurance plans, the premium is probably what youll notice first. Its kind of like the sticker price  its hard to miss.\nYou might be tempted to choose a plan based on premium alone, since thats the most visible price tag when youre shopping.\n1. The premium probably wont be your only healthcare cost.\nTry to resist the temptation to compare health plans based only on the monthly premium.\nYoull have other costs too, such as deductibles, copays, or coinsurance. These costs vary depending on how your plan is set up and how often you go to the doctor or fill prescriptions.\nTo truly compare plans, youll need to estimate how much healthcare youll use during the year, and add these costs to your premium.\n2. Higher premiums might be a better deal.\nWhen you look under the hood at some of the plans youre comparing, you may notice something interesting. Though the plans that have lower premiums are more attractive up front (who wouldnt want to spend less every month?), they usually have a higher deductible, higher customer coinsurance, and higher copays for prescriptions. So while you might save on the monthly premium, when you add in your out-of-pocket costs, you may end up paying more.\nBy contrast, when you dig in to some of the plans with higher premiums you may find that they can actually save you money in the long run. Higher-premium plans often have lower deductibles, lower coinsurance, and lower copays. Higher-premium plans might also have more in-network doctors and hospitals.\nOur advice? If you think youll be using a lot of healthcare over the course of the year  say youre planning to have a baby, or you have a chronic condition like diabetes or asthma  dont let higher premiums scare you off. These plans could be a better choice, when you add everything all together.\n(If youre having trouble with the math, use theGetInsured Expense Estimateor call a GetInsured broker. Theyll be happy to help you compare your options.)\n3. Its possible to get help paying your monthly premium.\nIf youre one of the 26 million Americans who qualify forhealth insurance tax credits, the federal government will help you pay your premium. For those who qualify, the tax credit makes monthly premiums a lot easier to handle. You might also be eligible forMedicaidorCHIP for your kids, another way to get insurance thats affordable, or even free.\nSo be sure tocheck your eligibility for tax creditsbefore you shop for insurance  you may be pleasantly surprised at how much your premium will go down. (Many of GetInsureds customers have been able to pay their whole premium with tax credits  which feels like getting health insurance for free.)\nIf youre one of those lucky people who never gets sick, you may be asking yourself what youre really going to get for that premium:\n"}
