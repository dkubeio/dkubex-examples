More than \n1.3 million Americans\n, including tens of thousands of children, have lost coverage through Medicaid and CHIP following the end of pandemic protections on April 1, which triggered redeterminations across those programs.\n\nIn response to these alarming statistics, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra sent a letter to state governors on June 12 imploring them to take steps to ensure that eligible beneficiaries do not lose their healthcare coverage. Nobody who is eligible for Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program should lose coverage simply because they changed addresses, didnt receive a form, or didnt have enough information about the renewal process, said Secretary Becerra in the letter.\nIn response to these alarming statistics, \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra sent a \nletter\n to state governors on June 12 imploring them to take steps to ensure that eligible beneficiaries do not lose their healthcare coverage.

These new flexibilities include:\n\nAllowing managed care plans to assist people with Medicaid with completing their renewal forms, including completing certain parts of the renewal forms on their behalf.\n\nAllowing states to delay an administrative termination for one month while the state conducts additional targeted outreach, giving people more time to be reminded to fill out and return their renewal forms.\n\nAllowing pharmacies and community-based organizations to facilitate reinstatement of coverage for those who were recently disenrolled for procedural reasons based on presumptive eligibility criteria.\n\nIn his letter, Secretary Becerra also encouraged governors to work more directly with families at risk of losing coverage, suggesting that state agencies work with schools, faith-based groups and other community organizations to conduct outreach to enrollees about the redetermination process. While it is true that individuals can reapply for these programs if they still qualify, many people are not aware of these appeal rights. There is also the issue that the grace period for reapplication doesnt apply to all beneficiaries in several of the states with the largest numbers of cuts.\nIn his letter, Secretary Becerra also encouraged governors to work more directly with families at risk of losing coverage, suggesting that state agencies work with schools, faith-based groups and other community organizations to conduct outreach to enrollees about the redetermination process.
