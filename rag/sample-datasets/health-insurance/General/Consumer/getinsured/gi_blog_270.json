You own your HSAnot the government or your employerso you get to keep it even if you switch jobs. And the money you put into the account is not taxed.\nNot everyone can open an HSA. Only those enrolled in a qualified high-deductible health insurance plan are eligible.\nHigh-deductible health plans have low monthly premiums; however cost-sharing by the insurance carrier  when your insurance company starts helping you pay your medical bills  doesnt kick in for most services until youve meet a pretty high deductible, often $3,000 or more. The idea behind an HSA  pairing a health-expenses-only savings account with a qualifying high-deductible health plan  is that youll be more careful about how you spend your healthcare dollars because youre paying more of your medical bills out of your own pocket. At least thats the theory.\nIf youre eligible, you can set up an HSA on your own (through a bank or other financial institution that offers it) or through your employer. As far as deciding whether an HSA is a good choice for you, youll need to think about your healthcare needs, and your budget.\nAn HSA can save you a bundle if youre generally healthy and you dont think youll need much medical care in the near future. Heres how:\nFor 2015, individuals can contribute up to $3,350 per year into an HSA.Or up to $6,650 if you have family coverage. If youre between the ages of 55 and 65 you can sock away an additional $1,000 as a catch-up contribution. Just remember that HSA funds are only tax-free when used for what the IRS calls qualified medical expenses such as doctors visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. Be aware that if you use HSA funds for non-qualified expenses before youre 65 years old, youll not only have to pay income tax on those funds, you may also have to pay an additional 20 percent penalty fee.\nYou can only make contributions to your HSA while youre enrolled in a qualifying high-deductible plan.If you switch to a different type of plan, youll no longer be able to put money into the account; however, any funds youve accumulated can still be used  tax-free  to pay for future qualifying medical expenses. Again, the money stays with you.\nThe bottom line:A health savings account may be a good choice for you if youre generally in good health and youd like to put away some tax-free funds to use for future healthcare expenses. If youre close to retirement, an HSA might make sense because any money you save (while youre still working) can be used to pay for medical care after you retire.\nHSAs do have their downside. Healthcare needs can arise out of nowhere. Perhaps you notice an unusual symptom, or just dont feel well, but you put off going to the doctor to try to save money. You could risk a minor health problem becoming a major headache. (Which defeats the point of having health insurance.) Plus, if you dip into your HSA for anything other than qualified medical expenses, youll have to pay income taxes, plus that additional 20 percent penalty tax (unless youre 65 and older, or youre disabled) on whatever you withdraw.\nIf youre opening your own HSA, rather than through an employer, think about whether youre the type of person who will put money aside. Can you give up your daily grande non-fat decaf two-pumps-vanilla no-foam latte and put that money away?!\nSomething else to think about is your age. Once youve applied for social security, youll automatically be enrolled in Medicare Part A, and that means you can no longer make contributions to your HSA. In fact, the IRS says you cant make any more contributions up to six months before going onto Medicare.\n"}
