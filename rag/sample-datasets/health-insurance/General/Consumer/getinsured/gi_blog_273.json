Beginning in 2014 every qualified health plan, or QHP, must offer a group ofessential health benefitsand limit your out-of-pocket medical costs. QHPs must also be certified, or OKd, by the state or federal marketplace where you buy it.\nQHPs also put limits on cost-sharing expenses like deductibles, copayments, and out-of-pocket maximums. In 2015, the most an individual will have to pay for in-network, covered medical care is $6,600. The limit for families is $13,200.\nBe assured that all plans sold in a government marketplace are qualified health plans.This includes both the federal and state-based marketplaces. You can also buy a QHP from acertified Web broker like GetInsured, which is an approved government partner. (Some  though not all  employer-sponsored plans meet the requirements of a QHP.)\nThere are different levels, or tiers, of QHPs, but they all offer the same essential health benefits.All plans sold in the marketplace fall into one of four levels: platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Known as themetal tiers, each level differs according to how much of your medical expenses are covered after you meet your deductible. But they all include the same core group of benefits.\nWhichever tier plan you choose, you can be sure youre getting the same amount and quality of healthcare.\nYou must buy a QHP in the marketplace to be eligible for tax credits.If your income falls within a certain range you may be eligible fortax credits to help pay your premiums. And, depending on your income, you might be eligible for somecost-sharing benefitswhen you buy a silver-tiered plan.\nHowever, tax credits can only be used when you buy your coverage on the marketplace, or through a certified Web broker like GetInsured. You cant use them if you buy a plan outside the marketplace, even if it is a QHP. (TheGetInsured Estimatorcan help you find out if youre likely to qualify for discounts.)\nJust because a plan isnt qualified doesnt mean it isnt good. It just means it hasnt gone through the certification process. For example, many employer plans are considered grandfathered (meaning they were created before March 23, 2010, and are not required to meet ACA standards) and have not been certified. Despite this, many still offer a complete list of benefits at an affordable price.\n"}
