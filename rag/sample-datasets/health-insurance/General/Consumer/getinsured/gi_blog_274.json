(This is part of the healthcare reform law.)\nBut watch out: Plans dont cover all drugs. And how much the insurance company pays for your medicine can vary, depending on:\nMedicine is expensive. And if youre filling prescriptions each and every month, you already know how quickly those costs can add up.\nHealth insurance can help. By law, any comprehensive plan you buy for yourself or your family must include prescription drug coverage. But its tricky  not every plan will cover every drug. Before choosing a plan, you need to know exactly how much youll shell out for the medicines you rely on.\n1. Even if your insurance covers the medication, youll likely still have to pay some of the cost.Lets say you just got a prescription from the doctor. You drive to the pharmacy to pick it up, and the pharmacist asks for your credit card. You thought insurance would cover your medicine  so what gives? You need to know that your medicine could still be subject to a deductible, copays, or coinsurance. In other words, covered doesnt necessarily mean free.\n2. Not all drug coverage is created equal.Some drugs are really expensive. Some are relatively cheap. Any health insurance plan you choose is going to provide different levels of coverage for different drugs. What they cover depends on the drug and how expensive it is. When choosing a plan, be sure you check to see just how much coverage youll get for the medicines you take most often.\nHere are the typical ways that plans are organized:\n3. It pays to ask specific questions about your medications.Many drugs get prescribed by doctors for different conditions. For example, the same medicine might lower cholesterol for one patient and prevent mini-strokes for another patient. Just because a drug is on a covered list, that doesnt mean its covered at the same level for all uses. So be sure to ask the health insurance carrier and your doctor about coverage for your particular prescription.\n4. Your plan might have a separate drug deductible.Some health insurance plans ask you to meet a drug deductible before they start helping to pay for your medications. In other words, youll have to pay the first few dollars for prescriptions out of your own wallet. Once you meet your drug deductible, the insurance company will start to share your costs. (And this drug deductible might be separate from the overall plan deductible.)\nBut heres the thing: Even if your plan has a drug deductible, the deductible might not apply to every drug. For example, lets say your plan breaks drugs into tiers. You might have to meet a drug deductible before your plan helps pay for tier 4 drugs, but your plan might help pay for tier 1 drugs from the get-go.\n5. Some plans limit how much youll have to pay for medicine in a year.You may be able to buy a plan with an out-of-pocket max specifically for medications. With these plans, theres a cap on the total amount youll have to pay for prescriptions in a given year  which is great if you take a lot of medicines.\nBe sure to read your plans details about prescriptions carefully.\n"}
