In some states your premium could be as much as 50 percent higher. (On average, though, tobacco users pay about 10 percent more than nonusers.)\nThe following products are considered to be tobacco:\nGenerally, youre considered a regular tobacco user if youve used any of these products four or more times a week during the past six months (excluding religious or ceremonial use).\nThanks to the new healthcare reform law, youll never be charged more for health insurance if you have a pre-existing health condition.\nBut youcanbe charged more if youre a regular tobacco user.\nWhy?\nSo, in states where its allowed, insurance companies can charge you extra  a tobacco surcharge  because youre a tobacco user. And you have to report this on your health insurance application. If you dont and your insurance company finds out, they cant cancel your coverage, but they can start adding the tobacco surcharge to your premium. They can also ask you to pay the surcharge for the months that have passed since you first enrolled\n1. You cant use tax credits to pay the tobacco surcharge.If youre one of 26 million Americans who qualifies fortax credits(government dollars to help pay for health insurance), you wont be allowed to use them to cover the extra costs associated with tobacco. Youll have to pay the tobacco surcharge on your premium directly.\n2. You must provide tobacco-use information for everyone in your household.If youre a household of one, answering the question will be easy: You already know whether or not you smoke and how often. But if youre buying health insurance with your spouse or dependents over the age of 18, youll need to provide their tobacco-use information as well. Be sure to get this information from them before completing your application.\n3. Where you live matters.Some states have decided to let insurance companies charge tobacco users a higher premium for their health insurance. Other states have not. Here are the states where tobacco use may affect your health insurance rates:\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n4. How frequently you use tobacco matters, too.Lets say you have a cigar on rare occasions, maybe once or twice a year. In that case, youre not a regular tobacco user.

Dont lie.When you apply for health insurance, youll have to attest that youre telling the truth by signing your application. Some tobacco users might be tempted to downplay their habits. After all, the insurer isnt there to count how many cigarettes you smoke in a given week. But there is a risk. If the insurance company finds out that you are a smoker after all, they can demand that you start paying the tobacco surcharge. This can result in a huge hike in your monthly premium. They also have the right to go back and collect the surcharge retroactively  in other words, they can ask you to pay them the surcharge for the months that have already gone by since you first enrolled.\n"}
