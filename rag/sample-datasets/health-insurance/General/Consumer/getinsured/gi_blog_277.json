The answer depends, in part, on your household income.\nIn this case, household income has a very specific meaning. Technically, its your Modified Adjusted Gross Income, or MAGI. In plain English, its the household income (after some modifications and adjustments) that you expect to report on your federal tax return. The good news is, you probably already have last years MAGI on your tax forms, which can be a good starting point for estimating this years amount.\nIt might seem hard to predict what your income will be before the year is finished. But if you want to apply for government dollars to help pay for your health insurance, youll need to do just that.\n1. You should estimate your income for the same year you want the insurance.For example, if youre buying insurance for 2015, you should enter your expected household income for 2015. If your circumstances dont change much from year to year, your 2015 income will probably be similar to what it was in 2014.\n2. Be ready to back up your numbers.If the government asks for more detail, be ready with last years tax return, a W-2, a 1099, or a current paycheck stub.\n3. Your household income should include income from everyone in the household.Yes,everyone in your household that means anyone whos a dependent on your tax form, even if those people arent buying health insurance with you now. If you have a spouse and you file your taxes jointly, include your spouses income (even if your spouse gets health insurance from work). If you have a dependent child and he or she earns income, include that too.\n4. Income can be more than simply what you earn at work.Heres a list of what to include in your estimated income:\n5. Some of the money that comes your way doesnt need to be included in your estimate.When tallying your income, dont include:\n6. Dont guess.If youre at all uncertain about what your income is, or if youre confused by this list of what to include or not include, get help. Consult a tax expert or accountant.\n7. And dont fudge, either.You might be tempted to game the system by entering a number other than your real household income. Dont do it. First of all, its illegal to intentionally enter information you know is wrong. Second, your income is going to get formally verified. The government will compare your projection with other official records from, say, the IRS or the Social Security Administration. If your projection is wildly different from what you earned last year, youll have to provide documentation to explain your reasoning. Third, if your actual income turns out to be much higher than you project and you end up with more government help than you really qualified for, youll have to pay the government back. Thats a surprise no one wants.\nNOTE:This information isnt intended to be tax advice. Please visit the IRSswebsitefor a more detailed description of MAGI.\n"}
