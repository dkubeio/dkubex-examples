Thats one of the most important reasons to have health insurance  to help cover those huge expenses if an illness or injury lands you in a hospital room. (Or if youre having a baby.)\nFortunately, most health insurance plans are required to help cover the cost of hospital bills. Plans sold on any of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges must cover 10 essential benefits, and one of those benefits is inpatient hospital care.\nAn inpatient hospital stay is when youre admitted to the hospital by a physician for some type of treatment or a major procedure like surgery.\nEach plan covers hospital stays a little differently so be sure to read through your benefits carefully.Most plans require you to pay a share, or percentage, of the cost of your hospital care. This is called coinsurance, and it usually doesnt apply until after youve met your deductible. Other plans may require you to make a copayment (i.e., pay a set dollar amount) for a hospital stay, either instead of or in addition to paying coinsurance and meeting your deductible.\nNo matter how your plan handles cost-sharing, the way youre billed for hospital stays is often the same: confusing! Its unlikely youll get just a single bill for all the services youve received. In most cases, youll get separate bills for each type of care. Some of those could include:\nThe amount your insurance will pick up for each of these bills depends on your particular plan.\nIf possible, choose a hospital thats part of your plans network.And also check to see if the other service providers are in-network too. Just because your hospital is on your insurance carriers in-network list doesnt mean all the providers who take care of you will be. For example, your surgeon might be in-network (and would charge you a copay), but maybe the anesthesiologist he or she prefers to work with is not. In that case, you could end up paying the full cost for their services.\nDont be afraid to ask questions about whos providing your care, and whether theyre in your network. Also, be sure to check with your insurance company if youre unclear about whats covered and what isnt. Speak up if you dont understand something.\nIn the event of an emergency, dont worry about whether the nearest hospital is in-network.If you think youre having a heart attack, or your spouse is having trouble breathing, or your child fell off a scooter and fractured his arm, you can (and should) go to the nearest emergency room. All new health plans must cover emergency treatment in these types of situations, even if you go to an emergency department thats out of network. You wont be charged higher copays or coinsurance than youd pay for in-network emergency room care. This even applies to HMO and EPO plans, which typically dont cover out-of-network care at all.\n(However, its worth a heads-up here about a practice called balance billing. Thats when you receive bills for the unpaid balance of charges that are above and beyond what your insurance company covers.)\nIf you receive emergency care in an out-of-network hospital, you may not be covered for additional hospital care beyond the emergency room.If you require inpatient treatment, you may need to be transferred to an in-network hospital or ask your insurance company to cover your hospital stay.\nNot all hospital visits are overnight.If you go the hospital for a procedure such as a cataract removal, a test, or an MRI scan, you may be in and out in just a few hours. Thats called an outpatient visit. Your copays may be different  and significantly lower  than for inpatient stays, depending on your plan.\nIf you know theres an inpatient hospital stay in your suture, do your homework.If you live in an area where you have more than one hospital to choose from, you may save a bundle by shopping around and comparing facility, doctor, and other fees.\n"}
