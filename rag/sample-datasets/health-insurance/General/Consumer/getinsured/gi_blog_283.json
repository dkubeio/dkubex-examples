If you qualify, the government will help pay your monthly health insurance premium.\nYoure probably wondering who qualifies for a tax credit. The government figures out who will qualify based on household income, household size, and age of household members. About 26 million Americans will qualify for health insurance tax credits. Generally, you are not eligible if your employer provides you affordable health insurance that includes a certain amount of coverage. Affordable is a key word  theres actually a specific measurement for it under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Be sure to ask your employer for more details. One more thing: If youre eligible for Medicare or Medicaid, youll probably get your health coverage through those programs. People covered under Medicare or Medicaid typically dont qualify for tax credits.\nIf you do qualify, how do you find out how much youll get? To predict your tax credit, go to an online estimator, like the onehere on GetInsured. Youll be asked to provide your estimate ofhousehold income. Youll also be askedhow many people are in your household, and how old they are. It takes only a minute or two to find out whether youre likely to be eligible for tax credits or any other government assistance.\nHealth insurance tax credits help people pay their monthly health insurance premiums. Credits are paid in one of three ways:\n1. The government can pay the tax credit directly to your insurance company  up front.\nThis means youll pay less of your monthly premium. (In some cases, the tax credit may be enough to pay your entire premium, so your monthly premium cost would be $0.)\n2. You can receive it as a one-time credit on your next tax return.\nIn this case youd pay the full premium all year. Then, when you file your taxes, youd get a tax credit. If you owe income tax, the credit would be subtracted from what you owe  and youd owe less. If you are receiving an income tax refund, the credit would be added to the refund amount and your refund check would be bigger.\n3. Or you can do a little of both: Get some of your tax credits up front and some later.\nHeres how to do it: When youre applying for tax credits, youll be asked how you want to receive them. You can opt to use some of your tax credits in advance, which the government will pay to your insurance carrier to reduce the cost of your premium, and get the rest of your tax credits when you file your taxes (use IRS Form 8962). Youll see how to do this during the tax credit application process.

If you lose your job or have an unexpected gap in income, or if your family size grows, your tax credit amount could go up. If you get a promotion or a new job with a big raise, your tax credit amount could go down.\nIf your initial calculation predicts that youll get a tax credit  or even that youre close to qualifying  youll want to shop in a place that can help you access your credit. That way, if your income does change over the year, youll be able to get financial help.\nYou can access your tax credit three ways:\nDont get confused by various names for the tax credit!\nYou might hear it called different things: a premium credit, a premium subsidy, or  heres a mouthful  the Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC for short). Not to worry, they all mean the same thing.\n"}
