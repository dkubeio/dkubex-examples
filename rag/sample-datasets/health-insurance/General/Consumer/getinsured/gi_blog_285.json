If you need healthcare, these benefits will have a significant impact on your life.\n1. Maternity and Newborn Care\nYoull no longer have to worry about maternity and childbirth exclusions on your policy. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurers must cover maternity, childbirth, and your newborn babys care.\n2. Pediatric Services\nIf you have children, you know that even routine healthcare can bust the budget. Youll no longer be charged for many preventive services  including most childhood vaccinations. Your childs eye care will also be covered, as will some dental care (if your plan includes dental coverage or you purchase separate pediatric dental insurance).\n3. Preventive Services for Adults\nYou know those tests doctors say you should have every year but you skip because youre not covered? Now, even if you havent reached your annual deductible, you wont have a copayment for an annual wellness visit or for a host of preventive services, including cholesterol screening, colonoscopies, mammograms, pap smears, and prostate exams, depending on your age and gender.\n4. Emergency Services\nWhen an emergency strikes, you can concentrate on your health and well-being instead of wasting precious time trying to figure out if your insurance policy will cover your emergency room visit. You wont need preauthorization to go to the ER, and you cant be charged higher copays or coinsurance if you visit an out-of-network hospitals emergency room when things go wrong.\n5. Hospitalization\nIf you need to stay in the hospital for treatment for an illness or for surgery, your insurance has to help cover your costs at in-network facilities once you meet your deductible. And once you reach your out-of-pocket limit, your insurance has to pay 100 percent of your in-network essential health benefit expenses.\n6. Ambulatory Patient Services\nThats just a fancy way of saying your outpatient care when you dont need to go to the hospital.\n7. Prescription Medications\nNew health plans must cover at least one drug in every category and class listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia, the official publication of medications in this country. This means that while not all specific drugs are covered, at least one of each type or class of medication must be covered. When you pay for prescription medications, it counts toward your total out-of-pocket expenses.\n8. Mental and Behavioral Health\nMental and behavioral health services, including counseling and treatment for substance-abuse disorders, get a boost under the new healthcare law. Behavioral assessments for children and preventive services  such as depression screenings for adults  are covered. The total cost to you and the number of sessions covered vary by state.\n9. Rehabilitative and Habilitative Services and Devices\nIf youve been injured, are ill, or have a chronic condition, many of your rehabilitative services will be covered. This includes physical, occupational, and speech-language therapies. Your plan may also include coverage for medical equipment like canes, wheelchairs, and walkers. However, individual policies may differ on exactly which therapies are covered and for how long. Your plan may or may not include coverage for long-term disabilities and diseases. If you have a chronic condition, investigate the specifics before choosing your plan.\n10. Laboratory Services\nLab tests like routine blood screenings are covered if they are for recommended preventive care. If your doctor orders a test for diagnostic purposes, youll probably have some kind of payment, depending how your plan is structured.\nThese healthcare essentials offer a lot of great benefits, but there are some restrictions youll want to keep in mind:\nThe bottom line? Shop wisely: Ask questions and compare plans.\n"}
