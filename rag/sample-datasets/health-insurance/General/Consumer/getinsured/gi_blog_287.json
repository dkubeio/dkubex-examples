Thats why the Affordable Care Act offers some protection against high medical bills in the event of an emergency.\nAnytime you or a loved one has a medical situation that any reasonable person would believe could lead to serious disability or death if not immediately treated, you can head to the hospital without getting permission, or preauthorization, from your insurance company. And youll still be covered if the nearest hospital is out of network.\nWhen you buy an ACA health plan, your basic emergency room care will be covered, even if a hospital is out of network.When youre enrolled in one of themetal tierplans sold in any of the ACA marketplaces, you wont be charged highercopaymentsorcoinsurancefor any out-of-network emergency services. When its an emergency, marketplace plans (as well as most other health plans) also wont require you to get approval from your insurance carrier first before heading to the ER. And if youre admitted to the hospital, many plans will forgive emergency care copays altogether.\nHowever, that doesnt necessarily mean your ER visit will be completely covered.Heres where it can get a little tricky. Even after you pay your copays or coinsurance, out-of-network providers can still bill you for the unpaid balance of charges that are above and beyond what your insurance company covered. This is calledbalance billing. And those numbers can add up. Keep in mind that the laws newest limits on consumers out-of-pocket healthcare costs $6,600 for an individual and $13,200 for a family in 2015  apply only to in-network care.\nOnce your condition (or that of a family member) is stabilized, youll want your doctors to coordinate with your insurance company on continuing medical care with providers in your plans network.This is to avoid racking up huge medical expenses.\nRemember, dont use the ER for anything other than a true emergency.Its rare for a carrier to reject a claim for an accident or illness thats clearly life-threatening. But if you visit the ER for a medical issue that could be resolved by your primary care physician or at an urgent care facility, theres a good chance youll be billed for the entire cost of your visit.\nRead through your summary of benefits carefully.Some of the health plans you can buy outside the ACA marketplaces, particularly those offered by an employer, dont necessarily follow the guidelines outlined by the ACA. For example, some employer plans may require approval for emergency care within the first 24 hours.\nNone of us like to think about medical emergencies, but its smart to be prepared. You dont want to be left scrambling at a time when every second counts.\nKnow where your closest emergency room is in case you or someone in your family has a life-threatening medical issue. Thats the best place to get the care that can save life and limb.\nHowever, if you need immediate medical attention for something less serious, visit an urgent care facility instead. While not necessarily equipped to handle life-or-death situations, urgent care centers can often treat immediate medical needs faster, and cheaper, than a trip to the ER.\n\n"}
