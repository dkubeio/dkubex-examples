It also offers healthcare coverage to people with disabilities and low-income elderly folks who need help paying for medical care thats not covered by any other health insurance program.\nSome states refer to their Medicaid program by a different name. In Maine, for instance, its known as MaineCare. And in California its called Medi-Cal. States also vary in how they cover healthcare: Some pay medical costs directly to a provider, while others use private insurance companies to manage care.\nWhether or not you qualify for Medicaid depends on how much money you make and where you call home. If you live in a state that expanded its Medicaid program as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and if your household income is at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), youll likely qualify. That figure is what the government says is the minimum you need to pay for basics like food, transportation, and shelter. (For example, the FPL for a family of four, in 2015, is $32,913)\nIn states that chose not to expand their Medicaid program, eligibility will depend on your household income level, whos in your household and their age, as well as your states specific eligibility requirements.\nFor more information, or to see if you qualifycall or visit your local Medicaid office.\nEven if you dont think youre eligible, it still pays to check. Its possible your kids (and in some cases, you) could qualify for a related program known as CHIP  short for Childrens Health Insurance Program. In most states, CHIP is run out of the same office as Medicaid.\n"}
