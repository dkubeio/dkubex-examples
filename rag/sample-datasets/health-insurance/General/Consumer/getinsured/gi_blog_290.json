Heres how to break it down.\nTheres a limit to your out-of-pocket costs.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) puts a cap on how much you have to pay for your in-network healthcare every year  thats called your out-of-pocket max. And its set by law. So your coinsurance payments wont last forever  only until you reach your years max. After that, your insurer will cover in-network medical expenses. (Just remember that out-of-network services typically dont count toward your out-of-pocket maximum.)\nCoinsurance rates can vary within your plan.For example, a carrier may cover more of the cost when you stay overnight at a hospital than if you receive hospital treatment as an outpatient. This is one of those details that can surprise you later, so be sure to read your plans fine print. Or, if youd like help, speak with alicensed brokerto get advice.\nSome medical expenses arent subject to coinsurance.When you look at the details of your plan, youll notice that some medical services (such as a visit to your primary care doctor) dont have a coinsurance rate at all. Instead, they have whats called a copay, where you pay a flat fee toward the service rather than a percentage of the total cost. Be sure to learnabout copays, too.\n"}
