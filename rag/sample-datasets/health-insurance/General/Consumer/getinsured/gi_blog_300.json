Technology has revolutionized the way just about every modern industry works, and healthcare is no exception. The integration of powerful IT systems are constantly changing the way the business of healthcare is done, all in an effort to increase efficiencies, decrease wasteful spending and improve the quality of care.\nIT has been instrumental in ensuring patient safety and satisfaction, and because of that, this week were recognizing the 8th Annual National Health IT Week  policy makers and industry leaders on the immense value software and other technology innovations a weeklong forum to recognize and educate policy makers and industry leaders on the immense value software and other technology innovations bring to nearly every aspect of healthcare.\nRight now, a focal point in the healthcare landscape is the introduction of the health insurance exchange (HIX) marketplace, which gives more power and choice to consumers. Historically, health insurance has been a mysterious process with limited transparency and control. According to the Journal of Health Economics, the publics fundamental knowledge of insurance is inadequate with only 14 percent of the population understanding all of these four common health insurance terms: deductibles, copays, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Most consumers dont speak insurance and are instead left feeling confused and frustrated.\nLong before healthcare reform was enacted, our team here recognized this problem with the health insurance process. We believe that a simple, smart and personal approach is a formula for success in this field.\nJoin us this week as we follow the conversations about the value of healthcare IT, and how individuals can better manage their health (and choices), in the digital era by following the #NHITweek hash tag via social media channels.
