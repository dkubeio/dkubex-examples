Weve been managing and maintaining integrations with carriers enterprise systems since 2006, but in this blog post well focus on one of the most notorious file formats for enrollment and why its here to stay. In a future post well discuss how were moving towards a universal standard for enrollment.\nIn our industry the standard way to exchange enrollment data is via an ASC X12 benefit enrollment and maintenance file or 834 file. As any integration developer will tell you, its cumbersome to work with and its frustrating that every insurer has their own variant or configuration of the 834 standard.\nSo why do we keep using it when there are other, more common data exchange protocols such as XML?\nThe genesis for the various x12 transaction sets (including 834) came in 1991 when the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) was formed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Louis Sullivan. The following year, WEDI produced a report calling for the insurance industry to adopt EDI standards set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). A recommendation is not a law, but with some machinations through the Hillarycare proposals the surviving recommendations were weaved into the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which passed in 1996.\nHIPAA required that the HHS Secretary adopt standards for transactions, and data elements for such transactions and even specifically listed WEDI as one of the organizations that would be consulted on the formation of the standards. After the rulemaking process and four years later, HHS released the final standards for electronic transactions in 2000 which generally requires insurers to use the standards to exchange data between other Covered Entities or the Business Associates of Covered Entities.\nLong story short, HIPAA requires carriers to use the 834 transaction set with their Covered Entity trading partners and this has flowed down to most of the other third parties that interface with insurers. Its also the backbone of the enrollment and maintenance transactions between insurers and State and Federal exchanges.\nLiterally, it would take an act of Congress to dramatically change either the 834 format or introduce a new standard. Since Congress has many other priorities and any regulation would require re-configuring all of the state and federal exchanges, 834 is here to stay for a very long time.\nStay tuned for our next post on how leveraging the Federally Facilitated Exchanges 834 format (and companion guide) can allow insurers and their EDI trading partners to go to market with integrations faster and at a lower cost than what the industry is doing today. The 834 is also central to any effort by insurers to eliminate paper-based enrollment processing to reduce costs.\nThanks to my colleague Kyle Henderson for helping with this post.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.wedi.org/about-us\nhttp://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1252.html\nhttps://wedi.org/docs/public-policy/wedi-report-1992.pdf\n42 USC 1320d-1 and 1320d-2\n"}
