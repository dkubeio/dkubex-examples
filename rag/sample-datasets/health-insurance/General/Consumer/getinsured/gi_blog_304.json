In addition to featuring details from the latest Oliver Wyman study, she notes, Quietly and in a relatively drama-free way, the private health insurance exchanges are busily taking over the world of insurance and, in my opinion, portend a radical set of changes in how our health insurance system operates. Other key points made by Suennen include:\nPrivate exchanges are being seen as a viable option by employers of all sizes. No matter the headcount, employers are facing difficult decisions on how to provide competitive benefits while also balancing costly healthcare plans. In this recent Business Insurance article, two related studies are showing that healthcare costs are a big concern for midsize companies specifically. Highlights include:\nA recent survey we conducted of healthcare professionals indicates that large employer groups are expected to adopt a defined contribution (DC) model over the next five years; 70%of survey respondents said large employers will move away from the existing traditional defined benefit model to DC. This would be a dramatic shift in the future of health benefits for employers of all sizes and their employees, indicating that change in the health benefits space, like other consumer-focused industries, is governed by market demand and facilitated by innovative web-based technology.\n"}
