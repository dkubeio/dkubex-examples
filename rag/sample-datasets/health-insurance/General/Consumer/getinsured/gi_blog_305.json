Simply defined as a place for buying and selling commodities, securities, etc. (Dictionary.com), health insurance exchanges have existed for decades (the International Medical Exchange or IMX, for instance, was created in the mid-80s) but they were not widely recognizable or discussed. While the term has seen a spike in airplay since the ACAs creation, and particularly in the last 6 months with the start of open enrollment on October 1, the general publics understanding of exchanges remainsdebatable. I used ehealthinsurance.com to purchase an individual policy for myself in 2006 between grad school and the start of my employer-sponsored policy. Even though I was among a minority who knew it was possible to buy health insurance online, I certainly didnt know the site was an insurance exchange.\nThis lack of consumer recognition surfaced last January when Health and Human Services (HHS) acknowledged the shortcomings of the term exchange. In a blog post, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius formalized the federal governments shift from Affordable Insurance Exchanges to Health Insurance Marketplaces. Coverage and commentary from HHS attributed the rebrand to two things: 1) clarifying the sites purpose for consumers and 2) being able to translate the phrase into Spanish more accurately.\nThe validity of the original choice to use exchange has been debated, and not bringing consumer marketing folks to the table sooner may have been a gross oversight. A lack of public understanding led to the rebrand; the term itself may be accurate, but it fell short with consumer recognition and couldnt stand alone. At that point most of the state-run exchanges were branded already, and generally those names include some combination of the words: health/health plan, connector/find/link, and marketplace.\nOver the course of 2013, most materials focused primarily on the public exchanges included lines in their introductions like: health insurance marketplaces, a.k.a. exchanges, while those with a private exchange focus have started to include the inverse private exchanges, a.k.a. marketplaces. Mutual acknowledgement of this deviation in terminology will continue, but whether the public sectors use of marketplace will pull the private away from the term exchange remains to be seen. Toss into the mix a range of opinions on what makes a private exchange an exchange in the first place, and were in for all kinds of fun just communicating with each other in this space.\nFor now, were still seeing wide use of private exchanges and exchange platforms, with marketplace sometimes used to describe the consumer-facing or front-end component of a private exchange solution. For what its worth, Im betting that a few years from now carriers, brokers, and employers will be buying complete exchange solutions that generally include a marketplace component as their front-end shopping interface. How those buyers then brand their platforms for consumers, which is really what HHSs shift was about, is a whole different blog post.\n"}
