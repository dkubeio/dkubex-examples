Lets break down exactly what that means. \nOne of the benefits frequently covered when discussing the operation of a state-based exchange (SBE) is cost savings. Lets break down exactly what that means. \nOperating on HealthCare.gov\n\nAn assessment fee is charged when a state operates its health insurance exchange on the Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE), which is commonly known as HealthCare.gov. The fee is set annually by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is the federal agency that oversees healthcare.gov, and is used to operate and maintain HealthCare.gov. \nAn assessment fee is charged when a state operates its health insurance exchange on the Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE), which is commonly known as HealthCare.gov. The fee is set annually by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is the federal agency that oversees healthcare.gov, and is used to operate and maintain HealthCare.gov. \n\nThe assessment fee is calculated as a percentage of the health insurance carriers gross premiums written for plans sold on the Exchange. Carriers are required to pay this fee to the federal government on a quarterly basis, and the amount they pay is based on their gross premiums written for the previous quarter. The fee amount varies from year to year, depending on the projected costs of running the Marketplace and other ACA programs. For example, in 2023, the fee is set at 2.75 percent of gross premium.\nThe assessment fee is calculated as a percentage of the health insurance carriers gross premiums written for plans sold on the Exchange.

For example, in 2023, the fee is set at 2.75 percent of gross premium.\n\nHeres a real-life example. In 2023, in the state of Texas, average monthly premiums came in just under $580, and enrollment was more than 2.3 million people (about twice the population of New Hampshire). That means by the end of the year, insurers will have paid more than $443 million to the federal government. While the assessment fee is not directly charged to consumers, it can indirectly affect their premiums. Health insurance carriers pass on the cost of the fee to consumers by increasing their premiums. This means that consumers may end up paying more for their health insurance. In 2023, FFE state premiums exceeded state-based exchange premiums by more than $100 per month. \nHeres a real-life example.

State-based exchanges have more control over their operations and can tailor their programs to meet the needs of their states population. This can lead to greater efficiency and lower costs. \nOne of the biggest financial differences between the FFE and an SBE is that instead of the assessment fee going to the federal government, it goes to the state.

When the state was mapping out their plan, it was estimated that to run their own exchange, the state would pay between $30  $35 million. That means, if Pennsylvania continued to charge the same assessment fee, Pennsylvania would be looking at returning more than $60 million to state programs. In fact, a large portion of those savings were used to set up and run a reinsurance program to reduce the cost of coverage for residents who werent eligible for premium subsidies.\nLets look at Pennsylvania as another real-life example.

The exchange reported saving more than $33 million for consumers in Pennsylvania during its first year of operation. \nPennie was able to achieve cost savings for consumers through its negotiated rates with insurance companies and efficient operational model.

There are a few ways this can be accomplished:\n\nStates can opt to charge a lower assessment fee to carriers, which would decrease the passthrough costs to consumers. \n\nReinsurance programs can be set up to protect insurers from high claims. Reinsurance pools are away to stabilize a states insurance market and make coverage more available and affordable.\n\nSavings can be contributed to a larger pool that funds a state subsidy program. \n\nThe state can also help small businesses subsidize employee coverage. \n\nStates can invest in robust marketing and outreach to increase enrollment and improve the individual market risk pool.\n\nMany states are taking steps to invest in their health insurance markets and increase enrollment. Bringing assessment fees into the state througha state-based exchange allows the state to better respond to the needs of their unique markets and residents.\nMany states are taking steps to invest in their health insurance markets and increase enrollment.
