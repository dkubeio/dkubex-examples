While many are speculating that this may be one of the final extensions of the PHE, the recent federal decision to phase out the continuous coverage requirement come April 1, 2023, puts states in a position to quickly transition some of the countrys most vulnerable populations to alternate sources of health insurance coverage.\nOnce again, the Biden Administration has renewed the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE), marking the 12\nth\n extension since it was first declared at the outset of the pandemic to make it easier for millions of Americans to access critically important health programs.

However, the newly passed federal government spending law removed a number of core measures of the PHE. One of which is the continuous coverage measure a requirement that prevents states from redetermining the eligibility of Medicaid recipients. This means that on April 1, regardless of whether the PHE is still in place or not, states will be set to start Medicaid redeterminations.\nSince its declaration, the PHE has ensured that millions of Americans receive health insurance coverage, especially those who rely on Medicaid whose coverage has been safeguarded by the PHE.
