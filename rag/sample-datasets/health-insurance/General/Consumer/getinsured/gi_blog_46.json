This review is typically conducted on an annual basis, or more frequently, if necessary, to ensure that the person continues to meet the criteria for Medicaid, including income, citizenship, and other relevant factors. \nMedicaid redeterminations refer to the process of reviewing and updating a persons eligibility for Medicaid coverage. This review is typically conducted on an annual basis, or more frequently, if necessary, to ensure that the person continues to meet the criteria for Medicaid, including income, citizenship, and other relevant factors. \n\nThe redetermination process involves verifying information about the individuals circumstances and comparing it to the Medicaid eligibility criteria. This may involve obtaining additional documentation, such as tax returns, pay stubs, or proof of residency. The results of the redetermination are then used to determine if the person remains eligible for Medicaid, if their coverage needs to be adjusted, or if their coverage needs to be terminated.\nThe redetermination process involves verifying information about the individuals circumstances and comparing it to the Medicaid eligibility criteria.

This helps to ensure the integrity of the Medicaid program and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. These redeterminations were put on hold under the PHE. Now, as the Public Health Emergency begins to unwind after three years, states must begin redeterminations by April 1. \nThe goal of the Medicaid redetermination process is to ensure that only those who are eligible receive Medicaid benefits and that those benefits are accurately tailored to meet the individuals needs.
