In addition to decision support tools, which GetInsured offers to our state clients, standard plans are thought to make it easier for consumers to compare plan offerings.\nStandardized plans offer fixed maximum out-of-pocket value, deductible, co-payments, and coinsurance for select Essential Health Benefit (EHB) services. In addition to decision support tools, which GetInsured offers to our state clients, standard plans are thought to make it easier for consumers to compare plan offerings.\n\nFor plan year 2023, CMS began requiring Qualified Health Plan (QHP) carriers operating in Federally Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) and State-Based Exchanges (SBEs) using the Federal Platform (SBE-FP) to offer standardized plans. The NBPP for 2024 proposes expansions to this requirement. The proposed rule would require all QHP carriers to offer standardized plans for every plan type (HMO, PPO, EPO, etc.) and at every metal level, (except for the non-expanded bronze level) and in every service area the QHP carrier offers non-standard plan options beginning in plan year 2024.\nFor plan year 2023, CMS began requiring Qualified Health Plan (QHP) carriers operating in \nFederally Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) and State-Based Exchanges (SBEs) using the Federal Platform (SBE-FP)\n to offer standardized plans.

The Administration hopes that limiting the number of non-standardized plans will reduce consumer confusion and choice paralysismany consumers get frustrated and give up before completing the enrollment process because they cannot make meaningful choices and plan comparisons.

This alternative, however, is more stringent than limiting the number of non-standard plans. \nAs an alternative proposition, CMS has proposed that meaningful standards be applied to the plans being offered.

Out of the 18 SBEs, 11 currently have various requirements for their carriers to offer standard plans. Its clear that CMS is exploring options to make shopping on Exchangesa more consumer friendly e-commerce experience therefore reducing confusion and increasing the number of enrollments completed. \nAlthough State-Based Exchanges (SBEs) are not mandated to impose the standard plan regulations on their carriers, some SBEs do require standard plans to be offered.

Many consumers are unfamiliar with health insurance terminology and can become overwhelmed by the complexity of benefits and costs in a typical health insurance plan. Uncertain, confused, and anxious to make the right decision, consumers often settle for plans with the lowest premium even though this may not be the best decision for themselves or their families.\nChoice overload, however, isnt the only factor that contributes to consumer confusion during plan shopping.
