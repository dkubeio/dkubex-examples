The glitch began when the Obama Administrations \nTreasury Department interpreted the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the following way:\n\n\nThe only way an employee and their dependents may be eligible for a premium subsidy on an ACA exchange is if the employees cost of the lowest-cost self-only plan offered by their employer exceeds the threshold of 9.5 percent of the employees household income. (For 2023, this percentage has been lowered to 9.12%.)\nThe only way an employee \nand\n their dependents may be eligible for a premium subsidy on an ACA exchange is if the employees cost of the lowest-cost \nself-only plan\n offered by their employer exceeds the threshold of 9.5 percent of the employees household income. (For 2023, this percentage has been lowered to 9.12%.)\n\nIn other words, even if the cost of a family plan exceeded the income threshold, an employee-only employer-sponsored plan was below the threshold, the entire family becomes ineligible to receive premium tax credits on the health insurance exchanges.\nIn other words, even if the cost of a family plan exceeded the income threshold, an\n employee-only\n employer-sponsored plan was below the threshold, the entire family becomes ineligible to receive premium tax credits on the health insurance exchanges.\n\nOver time, the realization that millions of low- to middle-income families would not be able to afford family coverage became a significant concern to ACA supporters, consumer groups, and consumers. This concern eventually made its way to Congressional leaders, and we started to see the introduction of legislative proposals to amend the statute.\nOver time, the realization that millions of low- to middle-income families would not be able to afford family coverage became a significant concern to ACA supporters, consumer groups, and consumers. This concern eventually made its way to Congressional leaders, and we started to see the introduction of legislative proposals to amend the statute.\n\nSo now, if an employee and their dependents are offered a family plan by the employer  and if the cost of the lowest-cost employer-sponsored family exceeds 9.12 percent (for 2023) of the employees household income  the employees dependents will be eligible for a premium subsidy through an ACA Exchange. However, if an employee is still offered a self-only plan in which the cost of the plan does not exceed 9.12 percent of the employees household income in 2023, the employee is still not eligible for a premium subsidy, even though the employees spouse and dependents may be eligible.\nSo now, \nif an employee and their dependents are offered a family plan by the employer  and if the cost of the lowest-cost employer-sponsored family exceeds 9.12 percent (for 2023) of the employees household income  the employees dependents \nwill be\n eligible for a premium subsidy through an ACA Exchange. However, \nif an employee is still offered a \nself-only plan in which the cost of the plan does not exceed 9.12 percent of the employees household income in 2023, the employee is still not eligible for a premium subsidy, even though the employees spouse and dependents may be eligible.\n\nFor example:\nFor example:\n\nAn individual and their family are currently enrolled in an employer health plan with coverage effective dates of July 1, 2022  June 30, 2023. The family has a projected income of $80,000 annually. The employee pays $7,500 annually for their self-only employer sponsored plan (7,500/80,000 = 9.4%). The self-only employee coverage is considered unaffordable and therefore the individual will be eligible for subsidies on the Exchange.\n\nThe cost to cover the family on the employer sponsored coverage is $9,500 annually (9,500/80,000 = 11.9%). The family coverage is also considered to be unaffordable and therefore the family members are eligible for subsidies on the Exchange. \n\nWhile the rule has been finalized, GetInsured was able to quickly deploy the updated logic to state exchange clients to enable accurate eligibility determinations. As a result, consumers applying for 2023 coverage during the open enrollment period in GetInsured client states will receive proper eligibility determination for subsidies, including subsidies for those previously falling into the family glitch category.\nWhile the rule has been finalized, GetInsured was able to quickly deploy the updated logic to state exchange clients to enable accurate eligibility determinations.
