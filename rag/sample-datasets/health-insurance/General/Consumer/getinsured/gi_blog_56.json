Since open enrollment began on November 1, 2022 (apart from Idaho, which began October 15), just under 16 million people have selected a marketplace plan (a 13 percent increase over this week last year). These numbers show a positive uptick in enrollment across the country, likely due to federal and state-level policies designed to provide enhanced financial assistance to consumers and increased spending on marketing and outreach.\nJust days ahead of the end of Open Enrollment in many states, the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced\n where 2023 enrollment numbers stand.
