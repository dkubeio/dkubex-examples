extending ARPs ACA enhancements.The BBBA would also do the following:\n\n\nIndividuals With Income Below 100% of FPL\n:The ACAs premium subsidies would be available to individualswhose incomearebelow 100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).This means that low-income individuals in States that have NOT expanded their Medicaid program would now be eligible for a premium subsidy if these individuals purchase an individual market plan through an ACA Exchange.\n\nEmployees With Income Below 138% of FPL\n:Employees with income below 138% of FPL would be eligible for a premium subsidy even if these employees are offered an affordable employer-sponsored health plan.In addition, the spouses and dependents of employees with income below 138% of FPL would ALSO be eligible for a premium subsidy.Under current law, if an employee is offered an affordableemployer plan, the employee is NOT eligible for a premium subsidy.In addition, the well-known family glitch prevents spouses and dependents of an employee offered anaffordableself-only employer plan from accessing a premium subsidy.If the BBBA is enacted into law, the family glitch and the affordability test would be effectively eliminated for low-income employees.Note:employers would also NOT be required to pay the employer mandate penalty tax if any of their employees with income below 138% of FPLactually accessa premium subsidy.\n\nThe Affordability Percentage Thresholdfor Employees\n:For at least 2022 through 2025, employees would be able to access a premium subsidy if the cost of the employees portion of a self-only employer plan exceeds8.5% of their income.Under current law, employees must be required to pay more than 9.83% of their income toward an employer plantobe eligible for a premium subsidy.Note,if andwhenthis8.5%thresholdsnaps back to current law starting in 2026, this threshold would no longer increase each year (i.e., there would be no indexing in futureyearsstarting in 2026).\n\nEnactment of the BBBA Means Millions of New ExchangeEnrollees\nEnactment of the BBBA Means Millions of New ExchangeEnrollees\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) a non-partisan agency thatis responsible for estimating coverage gains or losses has yet to officially estimate how many individuals would purchase an ACA Exchange plan if the BBBA is enacted.However, CBO has provided estimates of prior versions of the proposals discussed above.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) a non-partisan agency thatis responsible for estimating coverage gains or losses has yet to officially estimate how many individuals would purchase an ACA Exchange plan if the BBBA is enacted.However, CBO has provided estimates of prior versions of the proposals discussed above.\n\nFor example, when analyzing the proposal to allow individuals whose income are below 100% of FPL to access a premium subsidy, CBO estimated that roughly 2.3 million more individuals would purchase an Exchange plan each year starting in 2022, 2023, and 2024.Note, this additional annual increase of 2.3 million people would be concentrated in the 12 States that have not yet expanded Medicaid in accordance with the ACA.\nFor example,

an Exchange planover 10 years.However, since the BBBAs proposal only extends these enhancements through 2025, this estimate is likely to go down, but it is reasonable to suggest that the number of new Exchangeenrolleeswouldstillbe in the millions.This is especially true when we look to the end of the public health emergency (PHE) whenwe willsee Medicaid redeterminations resume, resulting in disenrollment ofpotentiallymillionsMedicaid beneficiaries. But, more to come on that later.\nWhen analyzing a proposal to makepermanent (1) the increased premium subsidy amounts and (2) the expandedsubsidyeligibility,\nCBO estimated thatan additional3.4 million people would purchase an Exchange planover 10 years.\nHowever, since the BBBAs proposal only extends these enhancements through 2025, this estimate is likely to go down, but it is reasonable to suggest that the number of new Exchangeenrolleeswouldstillbe in the millions.This is especially true when we look to the end of the public health emergency (PHE) whenwe willsee Medicaid redeterminations resume, resulting in disenrollment ofpotentiallymillionsMedicaid beneficiaries.
