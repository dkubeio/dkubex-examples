It is worth noting, however, that thisruleis only applicable while American Rescue Plan (ARP) expanded subsidies are in place. If they do not get extended, this SEPprovisionwill go away.\n\nThe separate billing requirement that issuersneeded tosend a separate bill for abortion services in accordance with section 1303 of the ACAhas been repealed.\nFor SBMs this could alleviate any compliance monitoring, but this is an issuer requirement to do separate billing for non-Hyde abortion services, more so than anything directly impactingHealthCare.govor SBM operations.\n\nState flexibilitylimitationsestablished under the Trump Administration for section 1332 State Innovation Waivershavebeen repealed.\nThe repealof the 2018 regulations will give states more flexibility when applying for a 1332 waiver.States can explore innovative ways to providebetter access to care, lower the cost of coverage, and decrease costs to the federal government.\n\nWant to learn more about ways a state-based marketplace can benefit your state and its health insurance market?
