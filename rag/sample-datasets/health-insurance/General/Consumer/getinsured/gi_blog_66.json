These past two years, the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) has brought to light how important it is to have health insurance. In order to give consumers more time to find a health plan, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permanently extended Open Enrollment, which now runs from November 1 through January 15 each year.\nAlthough most states default to these federal dates, some states, namely those with their own State-Based Marketplaces (SBMs), have varying Open Enrollment Periods. This year three new states have joined those operating their own SBM  Kentucky, Maine, and New Mexico  bringing the total to 18.\nOpen Enrollment provides both new and existing consumers the opportunity to shop for health and/or dental plans that best fit their needs. Its important to brush up on basic shopping terms and to be aware of your states enrollment period. To help with plan selection, many states, particularly those states that set up their own exchanges, offer sophisticated online consumer decision support tools to help new and renewing customers pick plans that fit their needs. Simply enter your preferred providers, including how often you see them, prescriptions you are taking, and some additional basic information like zip code and household size. Youll then be presented with plans that meet your search requirements along with their monthly premiums. If you are not comfortable with the electronic decision support tool, or just want a second opinion, you always have an option to call a call center or a local insurance broker certified to assist with Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans. The best news: due to the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) subsidies, many plans offered on exchanges come with very low, even $0 premium plans.
