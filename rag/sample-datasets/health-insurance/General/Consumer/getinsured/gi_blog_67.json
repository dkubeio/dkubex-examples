In March, the ACAs premium subsidies were increased under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) allowing individuals and families earning more than 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to access a premium subsidy, albeit only for 2021 and 2022. These two important policy changes that were made in early 2021 led to a record 14.5 million consumers enrolling in an Exchange plan during open enrollment 2022.\nOn January 27, 2021, President Biden announced the COVID Special Enrollment Period (SEP), allowing any eligible consumer to enroll in an Affordable Care Act (ACA) Exchange plan through August 15, 2021.

The Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats are seeking to extend the enhanced premium subsidies, at least through 2025, although a longer extension is possible. But nothing will be possible if Congressional Democrats are unable to move legislation that would extend the enhanced premiums subsidies.\nHowever, the COVID SEP is over, and without an extension, the enhanced premium subsidies will go away at the end of 2022.

If this skinny BBBA fails  and Congressional Democrats are unable to extend the enhanced premium subsidies on a stand-alone basis or through some other legislative vehicle  then it is logical to conclude that Exchange enrollment will retreat. Maybe not in 2023, but certainly in future years as those consumers who benefited from low-cost  and even $0 monthly premiums  will find it difficult to continue to afford health coverage. \nIf the enhanced premium subsidies are ultimately extended, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has indicated that we could see millions more consumers enrolling Exchange plans, on top of keeping the existing record number of Exchange enrollees.
