According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer thats detected early, while still localized in the breast, boasts a 90 percent 5-year relative survival rate. The benefits of early detection cannot be overstated. Mammograms, the primary screening tool for breast cancer, have played a vital role in decreasing mortality rates from the disease since the late 1980s.\nEarly detection is paramount when battling breast cancer.

A study published by the American Cancer Society found that uninsured women were significantly less likely to have had a mammogram in the past two years compared to those with insurance. This disparity isnt merely about numbers; it translates into more advanced cancer diagnoses and, tragically, higher mortality rates for uninsured women.\nThe truth is stark: Women with insurance are far more likely to get screened. \nA study\n published by the American Cancer Society found that uninsured women were significantly less likely to have had a mammogram in the past two years compared to those with insurance. This disparity \nisnt merely about numbers; it translates into more advanced cancer diagnoses and, tragically, higher mortality rates for uninsured women.\n\n\nNationwide, an alarming 10 million women, 11% of women aged 19 to 64, lack health insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). Further, 38% of women skipped preventative careand 23% skipped medical treatment during the pandemic. Across the U.S., women are dying due to avoidable reasons at the highest rate in the world, skipping crucial preventative services. Two out of every 1,000 deaths among women could be avoided, and access to insurance could be a key. The national average cost for a diagnostic mammogram is around $500 without insurance. Under the ACA, insurers must provide mammograms to women for free. For those without coverage, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, many imaging centers and hospitals provide mammograms at a reduced cost.\nNationwide, an alarming 10 million women, 11% of women aged 19 to 64, lack health insurance, a\nccording\nto \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).

Before the ACA, insurance companies could, and frequently did, charge women more than men for the same coverage.
