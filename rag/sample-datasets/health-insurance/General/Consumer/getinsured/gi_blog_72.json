While the clients all have that similar goal, theirneeds,and the way they work can differ significantly depending on the size and tenure of the exchange, the experience of the individuals involved, and the priorities of the specific state.

This may take the form of new programs that use state tax forms as entry points into the eligibility process or new tools for consumers who have limited access to the internet except on their mobile phones.\nI see states looking for new and deeper ways to engage with their residents to bring them into the Marketplace and to insure theyre getting the help and support they need throughout theapplication and enrollmentexperience.

Being based in California, luckily, she has ample opportunity to do that. She spends a lot of her free time gardening, bird watching, walking, biking, and hiking. But Dawn is also very much about continuing education as well.\nIve recently been learning more about formal decision-analysis methodologies to use for decisions that involve many variables and constraints. These methods can be useful for making tradeoffs and analyzing risk.\nDawns more than eight years of exchange experience, determination to constantly improve the product, and her drive to always be learning, make her one of GetInsureds resident experts and an asset to each of our state clients.\n"}
