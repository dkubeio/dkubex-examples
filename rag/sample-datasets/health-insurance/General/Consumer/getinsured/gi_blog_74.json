Putting these two together led me to the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Nevada Health Link), where I spent the last five years. It was there that I really cut my teeth on the inner workings of state-based marketplaces and how much federal and state policy drive every aspect of the exchange. I was able to work with and learn fromsome of the brightestminds inthestate-basedexchange business.During thistime,I also completedaMaster of Studies in Lawwith a focus on healthcare.\nI always had an interest in business(I hold aBachelors in Interdisciplinary Studies with a focus on Business AdministrationandPsychology, as well as an Associates in Business Management),and after working for social services in the Nevada Department of Welfares Medicaid eligibility unit, my love of healthcare policy was ignited.

I saw firsthand the huge impact Nevada Health Link had on Nevadans and I wanted to be able to affect change for even more people. Dont get me wrong, my heart beats for Nevada, but at GetInsured I have the opportunity to make a difference across several states, instead of just one. Im passionate about healthcare policy and how it gets implemented at the state level; now I can make these changes easier on our clients and help more Americans access affordable coverage.\nI wanted to take the next step.

I spent a lot of time at Nevada Health Linkworking on somepretty technicalback-end stuff, so I have a solid understanding of what makes an exchange run. Since the Biden Administration took office, there have been several policy changes thathave really impacted how state-based marketplaces operateand we anticipate there will be more in the years ahead. I can takethese newpolicies, breakthemdown, and with my operations experience, create plans and strategies to make implementationsof any future changes easier on everyone involved.\nI believe I can really make policy change implementations easier on our clients.
