Under this type of Program, the Federal government would prescribe the benefits that would be covered, and the government would administer the health coverage. The government would also establish the prices that Medicare would pay for the covered benefits.\nFor example, a Medicare-for-All Program could be put into place where every American regardless of age, income, or job-status would be enrolled in Medicare.

This Medicare-Buy-In Program might only be available to individuals of a certain age (e.g., 55 or 60 years old). Here, the Federal government would prescribe the benefits that would be covered and also establish set-prices for the covered benefits. The government might administer the health coverage  or  the government could choose to outsource the administration of the Program to private insurance companies (somewhat similar to how Medicare Advantage works today). \nAlternatively, policymakers could allow individuals to buy into Medicare through a Medicare-Buy-In Program.

Here, any individual turning 55 or 60 would be eligible to be covered under Medicare. This Medicare Program would work just like the traditional Medicare Program works today for individuals 65 and older.\nAnother way to expand Medicare is by simply lowering Medicares eligibility age to, for example, age 55 or 60.

This is yet another way to expand Medicare because currently, the only way Medicare beneficiaries can get coverage for dental, vision, and hearing benefits is through supplemental coverage such as Medicare Advantage plans.\nMost recently, there has been a robust discussion over adding auxiliary benefits such as vision, dental, and hearing benefits to traditional Medicare.

It is important to emphasize that proposals that are included in reconciliation legislation must meet specific criteria, and there is no guarantee that these two proposals to expand Medicare will end up in a final reconciliation bill passed by both the House and Senate.\nThese proposals are scheduled to be included in legislation that will be processed through Congresss reconciliation (a process that only requires a majority vote in the Senate and the House to pass the legislation).

However, at this point, it appears that the White House and Democratic Congressional Leadership are going to everything they can (1) to find ways to pay for the spending under each proposal and (2) to get the necessary votes to make these expansion proposals a reality. \nThat is all a long way of saying this: While Congressional Democrats and the Biden Administration want to expand Medicare in the above stated ways, there is no guarantee that these expansion proposals will become law.
