States, rather than the federal government, are in the best position to address issues unique to their markets and to their citizens. States are more responsive to the specific needs of their communities and are better able to protect the interests of consumers.

For example, SBE states are given full control over Qualified Health Plan (QHP) certification and in conducting outreach and marketing efforts. QHP certification encompasses all aspects of reviewing and approving rates, benefits, forms, marketing materials, and other materials under traditional state regulatory oversight, but also extends to final decisions on whether to certify or decertify QHPs. In addition, SBEs have the authority to set and collect user fees as well as determine rules around special and annual enrollment periods.\n\nWhile minimum federal regulatory standards apply to each of these areas, states are generally given flexibility to design and implement SBEs as they see fit within those standards. For example, states could choose to build SBEs in a way that facilitates private sector pathways to coverage such as brokers and\ninsurance carriers\n, enabling these partners to offer more tailored, customized consumer shopping experiences that are often preferred by newer, younger consumers needed to st\na\nbilize the risk pool\n, as we are seeing in the State of Georgia\n.\n\nBetter technology and lower costs make it easier than ever for states to establish and operate their own SBEs, saving taxpayers and enrollees money.\nBack in 2013, a number of states spent hundreds of millions of\nfederal\ntaxpayer dollars to build their own health insurance exchanges. Much of this spending was wasteful and led to poor results for consumers\n.\n\nHowever, like with most other technologies, the cost of building an exchange has gone down significantly while technology and performance has drastically improved. Recently states including Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey have successfully migrated away from the federal platform to create their own exchanges at a fraction of the cost of the earlier exchanges. They are also able to run their exchanges at a lower user fee than other states and the federal government.\nIt is important to note that today, enrollees on the federal platform pay user fees to the federal government in the form of higher health insurance premiums. The burden of paying the user fee falls primarily on taxpayers and unsubsidized enrollees who dont directly benefit from using the exchange. By establishing its own\nexchange\n,\nstates\nwould have the opportunity to reduce this burden on its enrollees by charging a lower user fee or seeking an alternative means to fund exchange operations\n.\nIn addition tosetting up exchanges, reinsurance pools in several states have proven an effective way to lower premiums, saving both the consumer and the state money.The below graph illustrates the decline in premium costs after initiating a reinsurance pool (marked by the blackdot on theline graph).\nIn addition to\nsetting up exchanges, r\neinsurance pools in several states have proven an effective way to lower premiums, saving both the consumer and the state money.\nThe below graph illustrates the decline in premium costs after initiating a reinsurance pool (marked by the black\ndot on the\nline graph\n).\n \n\n \nA well-designed SBE can serve as the foundation for future, market-based reforms.\nBecause of the additional regulatory and design flexibility afforded them, SBEs can also be effective platforms for implementing market-oriented health reforms. In November 2019, CMS issued four waiver concepts designed to take full advantage of the ACAs Section 1332 State Innovation Waivers. These concepts include reforms that make coverage more affordable, available, and consumer-centric, including:\n\nState-Specific Premium Subsidies:\nRedefine the amount of financial assistance provided as a state subsidy, such as a state tax credit, or redefine the populations eligible for financial assistance\n. To-date, California and New Jersey have implemented state-specific premiums.\n\nAdjusted Plan Options:\nProvide state financial assistance for non-QHPs or expand the availability of catastrophic plans, potentially increasing consumer choice and making coverage more affordable\n\nA\nccount-Based Subsidies:\nDirect public subsidies into a defined-contribution, consumer-directed account that an individual uses to pay health insurance premiums or other health care expenses.\n\nNow is the time for states to take action to reassert their traditional role in overseeing their health insurance markets, including by establishing their own State-Based Exchanges, Pate adds.\n\nN\now is the time for states to take action to reassert their traditional role in overseeing their health insurance markets, including by establishing their own State-Based Exchanges\n, Pate adds.\n\n\n\n\n"}
