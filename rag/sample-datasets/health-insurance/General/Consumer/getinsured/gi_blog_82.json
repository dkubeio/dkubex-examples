To fund their ongoing operations, the statute and implementing regulations suggested that an Exchange may impose user fees on the health insurance issuers selling health plans through the marketplace.\nHealthCare.gov and User Fees\nCurrently, there are 36 States that utilize the Exchange operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (i.e., HealthCare.gov). Consistent with the statute and implementing regulations, HHS has opted to impose user fees on health insurance issuers operating in those States that rely on HealthCare.gov to fund the Exchanges operations.\nFor plans years 2014 to 2019, the user fee charged by HHS to fund HealthCare.gov was 3.5 percent. For plan years 2020 and 2021, HealthCare.govs user fee was reduced to 3 percent. In recently proposed regulations (which may be finalized any day now), HHS has lowered this user fee to 2.25 percent for 2022.\nState-Based Exchanges Using HealthCare.gov and User Fees\nThere are some States that are operating their own State-based Exchange, but these States are still using HealthCare.gov as their enrollment and eligibility determination platform (and these States also use HealthCare.govs call center).\nStarting in 2017, these States were required to pay a 1.5 percent user fee. By 2021, the user fee increased to 2.5 percent. HHS recently proposed to reduce this user fee to 1.75 percent for 2022.\nWhat Are HealthCare.govs User Fees Used For? \nLets start with what they are NOT used for. For example, functions related to the ACAs risk adjustment program and operations associated with calculating and paying the ACAs premium subsidies are NOT funded by the user fees.\nHowever, costs related to Exchange information technology (IT), health plan review, management and oversight, eligibility and enrollment determination functions including the call center, and consumer information and outreach are considered user fee-eligible costs for HealthCare.gov.\nFor those States that only use HealthCare.gov as their enrollment and eligibility determination platform (where these States conduct their own health plan certification reviews and consumer information and outreach), the user fee is still used for things like IT and call center functions.\nIllustration\nIn the case of a State that relies on HealthCare.gov to perform ALL its Exchange functions, the chart below should give you some perspective on how much money the user fees generate for HHS.\n\nShould HealthCare.govs User Fees Be Increased or Reduced?\nSome organizations argue that HHS should actually increase the user fees back to 3.5 percent  or at a minimum, keep the user fees at 3percent  and use any excess user fees to fund things like education, consumer outreach, and to further improve HealthCare.govs IT.\nOthers  including HHS  have argued that the user fees are passed-through to the consumer, thereby increasing the premiums that Exchange planholders are required to pay. By lowering the user fees, HHS would be lowering the premiums for Exchange plans.\nAlthough both sides have valid arguments, it is difficult to predict where HHS will land on the user fee percentages for 2022. As stated, we are expecting final regulations any day now that will answer this question for us.\n\n"}
