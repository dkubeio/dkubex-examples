But, States with a State-based reinsurance program willnotreceive any additional dollars because the savings came from the enhanced premium subsidies,notthe State-based reinsurance program.Interestingly, if premiums go down on account of a balanced risk pool, the need for a State-based reinsurance program will be diminished.\nWell, in the case of the increased subsidies and expanded eligibility, the fact that 1.3 million people will be newly added to the ACAs risk pools could reduce premiums by strengthening, improving, and balancing out the risk pool\n.
