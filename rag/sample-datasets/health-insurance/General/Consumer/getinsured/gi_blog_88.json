The structures of healthcare facilities arent as clear tothe consumer. One facility, for example, may have multiple independent facilities within it and they may each have their own billing agreements with carriers. This is often confusing to consumers as all these facilities may have the same name. Providers maintaining their datawith carrierscontinues to be a challenge. So, it isreally importantto have as updated a source of truth as possible.\nAccording to Your Health Idaho, an industry-wide challenge continues to exist for consumers when evaluating plans.
