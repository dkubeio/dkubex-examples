This program is a partnership between the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange and the Office oftheMaryland Comptroller,and represents the countrys first attempt to use income tax filing as an on-ramp to health coverage.1\nIn May 2019, Maryland created the states new Easy Enrollment Health Insurance Program (MEEHP), a tax time enrollment pathway\n,\nproviding assisted enrollment into Medicaid and Qualified Health Plans (QHP)\non a Maryland\nHealth Benefit\nExchange\nwith\na special enrollment period. This program is a partnership between the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange and the Office of\nthe\nMaryland Comptroller\n,\nand represents the countrys first attempt to use income tax filing as an on-ramp to health coverage.\n1\n\nThere continues to be a strong connection between tax filing and eligibility for insurance affordability programs. MEEHPs leveraging of taxreturnprovides both a remarkable opportunity to identify the uninsured and could help overcome one of the most serious obstacles to coverage: namely a lack of information about available assistance. Nationwide, there are a lot of misconceptions about the availability and affordability of health coverage, and Maryland expects that their new program will help to move past these misconceptions.\nThere continues to be a strong connection between tax filing and eligibility for insurance affordability programs.

Nearly 66.1% of enrollees were younger than 34 years old and 50% were from households with incomes of less than 100% of the federal poverty level. Data indicates that the program has the potential to target disproportionately uninsured populations. Tax time intervention also allowed MarylandHealthBenefitExchangeto increase awareness and visibility for the Marketplace among the uninsured population.\nUsing this approach, the exchange was able to deliver SEP eligibility notices to over 40,000 households.\nMore than\n4,000 Marylanders enrolled into insurance affordability programs through the MEEHP, with the majority (75%) enrolling into Medicaid.

If so, the exchange would be able to reach out to the filer to help them enroll in coverage. New Jersey launched as a state-based exchange in 2021 and has advanced legislation for a similar program. Virginia expects to have a state-based exchange in 2024 and plans to launch its easy enrollment program on or after January 1, 2022, in a phased manner.3\nRealizing that they can leverage the natural connection between health insurance and tax filing to increase enrollment among the uninsured, other states have followed Marylands example.\nColorados easy enrollment program will debut in early 2022.
