Launching a state-based marketplace during a pandemic magnifies and adds to this complexity. Despite the obstacles COVID-19 added to 2020, or perhaps in light of the obstacles, the launch of Pennie  Pennsylvanias new state-based exchange  reaffirmed that the benefits of state-based exchanges (SBE) continue to outweigh those of operating on the federally facilitated marketplace (FFM).\nLaunching a state-based marketplace is a complex endeavor.

The release also shared the states improved enrollment results after its first open enrollment period as a state-based exchange. Right there, several significant benefits of having an SBE have been demonstrated.\nPennie issued a press release on February 3rd announcing it will open a special enrollment period (SEP) in line with the new federal COVID-19 SEP. The release also shared the states improved enrollment results after its first open enrollment period as a state-based exchange. Right there, several significant benefits of having an SBE have been demonstrated.\nLocal health policy executed locally\nCOVID-19 has given us all a very real-life example of how having control over your states health insurance market is critical. When the pandemic first began raging in early 2020, Pennsylvania was still operating on Healthcare.gov (the federal health insurance exchange, also known as the federally facilitated marketplace or FFM). When other SBEs began opening special enrollment periods to allow those impacted by job loss to enroll in health insurance plans, states on healthcare.gov did not have this flexibility.\nCOVID-19 has given us all a very real-life example of how having control over your states health insurance market is critical.

When other SBEs began opening special enrollment periods to allow those impacted by job loss to enroll in health insurance plans, states on healthcare.gov did not have this flexibility.\nSeveral FFM states petitioned the federal government asking for them to open a special enrollment period, but they were denied. Now that Pennsylvania has made the transition to an SBE, it has the freedom to decide whether or not to mirror the new federal SEP. Of course, putting its residents needs front and center, Pennie will be reopening on February 15th.\nSeveral FFM states petitioned the federal government asking for them to open a special enrollment period, but they were denied.

It would be hard to say that this did not have an impact on enrollment nationwide. A study done by GetInsured in 2020 showed that one-third (34 percent) of uninsured Millennials surveyed did not even know that they can obtain health insurance through ACA marketplaces.\nUnder the former administration, marketing spend to raise awareness of health insurance options on the exchange, as well as funding for navigators and assisters was drastically reduced.

Pennie made use of postcards, emails, online ads, point-of-purchase, out-of-home, TV, paid search, radio, community outreach activities, and media relations in both English and Spanish. Basically, they took the proverbial bull by the horns and got the word out. And that activity certainly paid off.\nWith a state-based exchange, the state can decide how to fund local marketing.

And that activity certainly paid off.\nBy the end of Pennies inaugural Open Enrollment nearly 338,000 Pennsylvanians enrolled in coverage, a more than 5,000 increase over last year. Over 75,000 new customers enrolled in coverage through Pennie, a 9.7 percent year-over-year increase.(1)\nBy the end of Pennies inaugural Open Enrollment nearly 338,000 Pennsylvanians enrolled in coverage, a more than 5,000 increase over last year.

Conversely, the FFM does not provide any data for marketing efforts.\nAn added layer of benefit when it comes to marketing and outreach is that the state now has granular data about insured and uninsured citizens to better target communications from both population and messaging standpoints.

These savings go back to the state, allowing for the funding of reinsurance pools, to help increase enrollment, and lower premiums. On average, states can expect a 20 percent premium reduction when transitioning off of the FFM. Pennies first open enrollment period demonstrates exactly these results with a 14 percent year-over-year average premium reduction.\nSince the launch of the Affordable Care Act, private vendors have developed modular systems for a fraction of the original cost of setting up an exchange.
