The ECSEP  which ran from March 17 to May 15, 2020  was opened to allow qualified Nevadans who missed OEP to secure health care coverage.\nStandard SEPswhich allow for change of income, loss of a job, or movingare already in the GetInsured system and our customer service reps are routinely trained to handle them. In the case of Nevadas ECSEP, COVID as a reason wasnt baked into the system or training, so reps had to be brought up to speed on additional qualifying life events (QLE) for opening an SEP. Our Nevada Health Link consumer assistance center operations were apprised of the ECSEP on March 15 and our CSRs were trained by March 17. In a perfect storm kind of situation, due to the pandemic, the consumer assistance center operations also transitioned to a remote force shortly after the ECSEP went live.\nApart from being trained on the deadlines, effective dates, and eligibility requirements, the team received extensive sensitivity training. In circumstances like COVID, consumers tend to believe that anything impacting them is a life event. However, where health insurance is concerned, every life event doesnt necessarily translate into a qualifying life event with eligibility to enroll. So, our CSRs were trained to uncover as sensitively as possible if a consumers situation truly qualified for the ECSEP, with the goal of trying to get the maximum number enrolled.\nThe ECSEP was comparable to the first two weeks of regular season open enrollment. The table below compares the call volumes, service levels average handle times, and abandon rates between Nevada Health Links OEP for the 2020 Plan Year and the ECSEP.\n\nThe result speaks for itself  our customer satisfaction score for the ECSEP was 91.77%.\n\n"}
