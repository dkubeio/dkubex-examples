If you quickly peruse Senya Rahmils LinkedIn profile, two things leap out: that hes a get it done kind of guy with inspirational leadership abilities and dedicated to customer success. In a career that includes experience at Fortune 500 companies like Brocade Communications and Nortel Networks to start ups like Clarify, Replicon and Good Technology, Senya has been at the frontlines leading quality assurance and customer support functions. We sat down with Senya (virtually) to talk about his goals at GetInsured.\nWhat were your immediate goals when starting at GetInsured?\nWe needed to scale our support organization, so we would be able to provide the highest level of support to all our customers and help them succeed with their goals. We also wanted to ensure that GetInsured has repeatable processes for handling our customers issues. I see the support organization as being the voice of the customer within GetInsured for various requests within and beyond ticket handling.\nHow do you see the support infrastructure growing?\nMy highest priority was hiring the most capable customer support professionals. Apart from proven experience and the knowledge to resolve complicated technical issues, I placed a high value on customer support professionals who displayed clear communication skills and an unequivocal passion for customer support.\nAnother area of focus was providing visibility to tickets within GetInsured, so were all working towards effective resolution. To this end, we defined and implemented clear end-to-end ticket handling processes, including escalation paths to various groups within GetInsured. This is supported by a set of reporting dashboards accessible to customer support personnel and executive management at GetInsured.\nAdditionally, weve implemented regular and frequent communication with our customers about the status of various issues. We also scaled up regular training for the support organization to handle new product releases and new functionalities.\nHow do you see quality assurance interfacing with support?\nTypically, the quality assurance group is customer supports first contact for escalated tickets. This relationship is very tight and cooperative. We work closely together on reproducing problems and look for reasonable workarounds.\n"}
