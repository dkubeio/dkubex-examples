But today, GetInsured can set up and operate the marketplace quicker, better, and for a fraction of the cost. \nWhat does GetInsured offer for states?\nOne end-to-end vendor: We offer an all-in-one solution, meeting your states needs for an operationally efficient migration from a Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to a State-Based Marketplace (SBM) and for user-friendly tools and solutions to meet the needs of the consumer, agent, customer service representative, and administrative users.\nA technology platform with arich base configuration and continuing momentum: Our technology is mature and is being used in whole or in part by five state-based marketplaces successfully. \nA consumer support center that is built out and in operation today: We have been running call centers for our public and private sector customers for more than ten years now. Thus, we are able to provide our existing, proven, fully built-out operational call center with additional dedicated resources. \nSmall implementation footprint: Our implementation approach leverages best practices from marketplace implementations in these, and other, states and does not require extensive customization or a ground-up system build. GetInsured is the only team in the market that has successfully transitioned a state from the FFM to an SBM. \nQualified Health Plan eligibility and integration with Medicaid: The coordination of integrated eligibility between state exchanges and Medicaid has traditionally been one of the most significant challenges for SBMs. We leverage our experience and past successes integrating with other Medicaid eligibility systems, such as at YHI in Idaho.\nOngoing enhancements: Due to the ever-changing market, our platform will continue to evolve in the future. We customarily make usability, security, effectiveness, and efficiency updates across all our state and private customers. This unique feature of our offering helps provide states with a predictable budget.\nMarketplace Platform Advisory Council: In addition to having access to generally available enhancements, we also provide our customers access to our Platform Advisory Council comprised of our current customers. The councils purpose is to help all of our customers align their interpretations of ongoing feature requirements and coordinate improvements for greater efficiency.\nWhy State-Based Marketplace?\nIf your state currently leverages the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM), a state exchange can give you more control over rising premiums, as evidenced in \nresearch from The Commonwealth Fund\n suggesting SBMs have up to 20% lower premiums than States on FFM/healthcare.gov. Plus, the move from FFM to SBM is much easier due to new policies that encourage \nstates to leverage section 1332 waivers\n. \nWith a state-based marketplace, you are likely to reduce your costs dramatically, increase usability and operational efficiency, and support your states specific policy desires. The economics of state-based marketplaces have been proven to be more sustainable for many states than operating on the FFM.
