Thus, we are able to provide our existing, proven, fully built-out and operational call center solutions with additional dedicated resources.\nWhy use the GetInsured Customer Support Center Solution?\nOur consumer support center uses our own platform\n: Our consumer support center uses our own GetInsured platform. The platform is mature, is being used in whole or in part by seven state-based marketplaces successfully and does not just meet the requirements of state-based marketplaces, but includes five years of improvements that allow state-based marketplaces to operate efficiently.\nOur consumer support center is built out and fully operational today\n: We have been running consumer support centers for our public and private sector customers for over a decade. Allowing state-based marketplaces the convenience of not building a new center, but using GetInsureds existing, proven, fully built-out operational center with additional dedicated resources. Our consumer support center solutions are based on our analysis of individual state-marketplace needs, providing unique operational leverage in using both our technology and our consumer support center together, because our personnel are already trained and well versed on our technologies.\nOne end-to-end vendor option\n: GetInsured has the unique ability to collectively provide states with the option of an all-in-one solution, including both a technology platform and a consumer support center from one vendor. This minimizes any risk of gaps or balls dropped in the space between two vendors with differing responsibilities and commitments.\nTurnkey, Low-Risk, A+ Team:\n We understand that there are other vendors in the market who are solely in the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business with dozens of call centers and thousands of employees. Our team is much smaller, with most members having 7-10 years of insurance experience as well as hands-on experience with our tools, enrolling members for ACA plans for public and private partners. This is our customer support operations specialty.\nGet in touch\nWant to learn how our customer support center can specifically help your state, as well as estimate your savings?
