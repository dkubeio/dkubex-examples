Using the companys best-in-class technology, while still adhering to CMS regulations and best practices for consumer experience and security, GetInsureds solution allows carriers, brokers and states across the country to easily utilize EDE during the six-week FFM open enrollment period. But not all EDE pathways are equal. There are three distinct available phases of Enhanced Direct Enrollment. GetInsured is one of the few companies working to complete \nall three phases of EDE implementation.\nEDE for States\nIncreasingly, States are taking control over their own destiny and \nbuilding a State-Based Marketplace (SBM)\n, lowering costs to the state in the process. EDE is an important step in that direction. It provides states with an alternative to relying partly or even entirely on the FFM. The process of moving to a State-Based Marketplace may be gradual, and a number of states started the process by taking over vital functions such as plan management. EDE provides additional opportunity to control the eligibility determination functions.

After the ACA was implemented in 2013, the customer service model changed, requiring consumers in FFM states to deal with HealthCare.gov. Since eligibility determinations are made on HealthCare.gov, any policy changes had to be processed through the FFM, while billing remained a responsibility of the carrier, leaving consumers not sure where to go for help.\nBut with EDE, the power of outstanding customer service is now back in the hands of the carrier.Consumers can once again interact directly with the carrier to:\nShop for and enroll in on-exchange plans all on one branded experience;\nSubmit required documentation to the marketplace, such as proof of income and citizenship status, the lack of which could cost a consumer their eligibility. A loss in consumer eligibility is ultimately a loss to the health plan;\nMake premium payments;\nReport life changes and update their information; and\nEasily renew their coverage during open enrollment.\nCarriers can implement a cleaner, higher converting, plan enrollment experience on their own web properties, agent tools, and customer service portals, for a seamless branded customer experience.\nEDE for Brokers\nWith limited time to enroll consumers during the annual Open Enrollment (OE) period  which is typically shorter in states relying on FFM  precious time was lost to dealing with the complexity, downtimes, and slowed enrollment process when utilizing the double-redirect to HealthCare.gov. \nEDE allows brokers to:\nManage marketplace documentation on behalf of their client such as downloading 1095 tax forms, something previously unavailable to brokers.\nEasily process life changes, SEP enrollments, and renew coverage. \nProcess complex enrollment cases like Native American enrollment with no redirect to HealthCare.gov.\nEffectuate client plans by paying initial premium.\nWith EDE, the power of service is once again back in the hands of the broker. With no redirect for all enrollment cases the enrollment process is faster, allowing brokers to enroll more consumers during the limited OE period. EDE can also be incorporated into broker tools such as GetInsureds \nAgentExpress\n. Such tools are designed to increase agent efficiency by providing an integrated EDE workflow, customer relationship management and support platform. \nGet in touch\nWant to learn more about what GetInsured can do for you?
