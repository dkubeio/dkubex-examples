Many people already have qualifying health insurance coverage and do not need to do anything more than maintain that coverage in 2014.\nQualifying coverage includes coverage provided by your employer, health insurance you purchase in the Health Insurance Marketplace, most government-sponsored coverage, and coverage you purchase directly from an insurance company.

If you have more than one short coverage gap during a year, the short coverage gap exemption only applies to the first.\nIf you (or any of your dependents) do not maintain coverage and do not qualify for an exemption, you will need to make an individual shared responsibility payment with your return. In general, the payment amount is either a percentage of your income or a flat dollar amount, whichever is greater. You will owe 1/12th of the annual payment for each month you (or your dependents) do not have coverage and are not exempt.The annual payment amount for 2014 is the greater of:\nThe individual shared responsibility payment is capped at the cost of the national average premium for the bronze level health plan available through the Marketplace in 2014. You will make the payment when you file your 2014 federal income tax return in 2015.\nMarketplace\nFor example, a single adult under age 65 with household income less than $19,650 (but more than $10,150) would pay the $95 flat rate. However, a single adult under age 65 with household income greater than $19,650 would pay an annual payment based on the 1 percent rate.\nFind out more about the individual shared responsibility provision, as well as other tax-related provisions of the health care law at www.IRS.gov/aca.
