Under the ACAindividual shared responsibility provision, taxpayers are required to have qualifying health care coverage if they can afford it in each month or make a payment, called an individual shared responsibility payment, when they file their tax returns. Some taxpayers qualify for an exemption from this requirement for a variety of reasons: because affordable coverage was not available, they had a coverage gap of less than three calendar months, or they have low income and their state did not expand Medicaid, among other exemptions. In addition, some taxpayers will have coverage or qualify an exemption for some months and owe a payment for other months.\nindividual shared responsibility\n provision\nqualifying health care coverage\nindividual shared responsibility payment\nexemption\nIf you were without qualifying health coverage for a month in 2014, you should determine if you qualify for a health coverage exemption. If you qualify for an exemption you will not have to make the individual shared responsibility payment for that month. An exemption tool is available at HealthCare.gov to help you determine if you qualify.\nexemption tool\nWhile you can claim most exemptions on your tax return, some exemptions require you to apply for the exemption through the Health Insurance Marketplace. No matter where an exemption is obtained, it will be reported or claimed on Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions.\nHealth Insurance Marketplace\nThe IRS reminds taxpayers and tax professionals that using tax preparation software is the best and simplest way to file a complete and accurate tax return as it guides individuals and tax preparers through the process and does all the math. There are a variety of electronic filing options, including free volunteer assistance, IRS Free File for taxpayers who qualify, commercial software, and professional assistance.\nfiling options\nvolunteer assistance\nIRS Free File for taxpayers who qualify\ncommercial software\nprofessional assistance\nHealth Coverage Exemptions\nThe following is a partial list of available exemptions:\nShort coverage gap  You went without coverage for less than three consecutive months during the year.\nFor the complete list of exemptions and information on how to report or claim them, see our chart on IRS.gov/aca.\nchart\nHow to obtain a coverage exemption\nSome health coverage exemptions can be obtained only by applying for the exemption through the Marketplace while some exemptions are claimed only on a tax return. Other exemptions can be obtained either from the Marketplace or claimed on a return.\nIf your gross income is below your minimum threshold for filing a federal income tax return, you are exempt from the individual shared responsibility provision and are not required to file a federal income tax return solely to claim the exemption. However, if you file a return anyway  for example, to claim a refund  you can claim a coverage exemption with your return.\nYou must report or claim health coverage exemptions on Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions (obsolete), and attach it to your Form 1040, Form 1040-A or Form 1040-EZ. These forms can be filed electronically.\nHow to report health care coverage exemptions obtained from the Marketplace\nAn application for a health coverage exemption that is granted only by the Marketplace should be submitted to the Marketplace as soon as possible so you can properly report the exemption on your federal income tax return.\nIf you are granted an exemption from the Marketplace you will receive an exemption certificate number (ECN). The exemption is reported by entering your ECN in Part I of Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, in column C. If the Marketplace hasn't processed your exemption application before you file your tax return, complete Part I of Form 8965 and enter \"pending\" in Column C.\nYou do not need an ECN from the Marketplace for an exemption that you claim on your tax return.\nHow to claim health care coverage exemptions with the IRS\nIf your gross income or household income is below your filing threshold and you file a tax return, use Part II of Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, to claim a health coverage exemption.\nAll other health coverage exemptions are claimed in Part III of Form 8965. Use a separate line for each individual and exemption type claimed on your return.\nFor a complete list of exemptions and information on whether taxpayers obtain them from the IRS or the Marketplace, see our chart on IRS.gov/aca.
