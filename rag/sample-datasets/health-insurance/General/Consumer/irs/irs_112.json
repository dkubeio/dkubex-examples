For more information on ALE status, see the Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions Questions and Answers and section 54.4980H-2 of the ESRP regulations.\nDetermining If You Are an Applicable Large Employer\nEmployer Shared Responsibility Provisions Questions and Answers\nESRP regulations\nUnder What Circumstances Will an Employer Owe an Employer Shared Responsibility Payment?\nAn ALE member may choose either to offer affordable minimum essential coverage that provides minimum value to its full-time employees (and their dependents) or potentially owe an employer shared responsibility payment to the IRS.Depending on its decisions about offering minimum essential coverage to its full-time employees and their dependents, an ALE member may be subject to one of two potential employer shared responsibility payments.\nFor purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, a dependent is an employees child (including a child who has been legally adopted or placed for adoption) who has not reached the age of 26.Spouses are not considered dependents and neither are stepchildren or foster children. For more information, see the Description of Payments page.\nDescription of Payments\nAn ALE member will owe the first type of employer shared responsibility payment if it does not offer minimum essential coverage to at least 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents), and at least one full-time employee receives the premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.Two types of transition relief are available for this type of employer shared responsibility payment.\ntransition relief\nEven if an ALE member offers minimum essential coverage to at least 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents), it may owe the second type of employer shared responsibility payment for each full-time employee who receives the premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Marketplace.In general, a full-time employee could receive the premium tax credit if: (1) the minimum essential coverage the employer offers to the employee is not affordable; (2) the minimum essential coverage the employer offers to the employee does not provide minimum value; or (3) the employee is not one of the at least 95 percent of full-time employees offered minimum essential coverage.\nPremium Tax Credit\nMinimum Value and Affordability Requirements\nESRP Question and Answers\nESRP regulations\nHow Are the Employer Shared Responsibility Payments Calculated?\nAn ALE member may be subject to one of two employer shared responsibility payments, but not both, and the two types of payments are calculated differently.An ALE member may not be subject to both types of payments regardless of the decisions it makes about offering or not offering minimum essential coverage to its full-time employees (and their dependents).\ntwo types of payments\ntransition relief\nFor either type of employer shared responsibility payment to apply to an ALE member, at least one full-time employee must receive the premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Marketplace.\nAlthough expressed here as an annual number, each type of employer shared responsibility payment is calculated on a monthly basis and is not a flat amount for all ALE members. Rather, the employer shared responsibility payment amount will depend on either the number of full-time employees of the ALE member (for an employer not offering coverage) or on the number of full-time employees of the ALE member who receive the premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Marketplace (for an employer offering coverage that is not affordable or does not offer minimum value).\nThe employer shared responsibility provisions provide for an inflation adjustment beginning in calendar years after 2014. In the case of any calendar year after 2014, the applicable per-employee dollar amounts of $2,000 and $3,000 are increased based on the premium adjustment percentage (as defined in section 1302(c)(4) of the Affordable Care Act) for the year, rounded to the next lowest multiple of $10.\nFor more details see Notice 2015-87PDF (question 13).\nNotice 2015-87\nPDF\nCalculating the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment\nESRP Question and Answers\nESRP regulations\nMinimum Value and Affordability Requirements\nIdentifying Full-Time Employees\nDetermining which employees are full-time employees is central to the employer shared responsibility provisions.\nAn employer must identify its full-time employees to determine:\nALE\nemployer shared responsibility payment\nIn general, for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, a full-time employee is, for a calendar month, an employee employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week, or 130 hours of service per month.There are two methods for determining full-time employee status that apply for purposes of determining the amount of any potential liability under the employer shared responsibility provisions. \nFull-Time Employee\nESRP Question and Answers\nESRP regulations\nTransition Relief\nFor 2016, transition relief is available under the employer shared responsibility provision but only with respect to employer coverage with a plan year that is different than the calendar year (referred to as a non-calendar-year plan) and only for employers that meet the other requirements for the applicable relief. \nSeveral forms of transition relief under the employer shared responsibility provisions were available for calendar year 2015. Because employers generally offer coverage for a 12-month plan year and some plan years are different than the calendar year, certain forms of transition relief are available to plan years that began in calendar year 2015 and end in calendar year 2016 (the 2015 plan year).\nFor additional information on the transition relief that applied in calendar 2015, see section XV of the preamble to the final regulations.\nfinal regulations\nMore Information\nMore information about the employer shared responsibility provisions is available in our Questions and Answers.
