The forms are:\nForm 1095-A, Health Insurance Marketplace Statement\nForm 1095-B, Health Coverage\nForm 1095-C, Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage\nDepending upon your specific circumstances, the Health Insurance Marketplace, health coverage providers and certain employers may provide information forms to you to help you accurately report health coverage information for you, your spouse and any dependents when you file your individual income tax return. Health coverage providers, employers and the Marketplace will also file these forms with the IRS.\nIf you are expecting to receive a Form 1095-A, you should wait to file your income tax return until you receive that form. Some taxpayers may not receive a Form 1095-B or Form 1095-C by the time they are ready to file their tax return and it is not necessary to wait for Forms 1095-B or 1095-C in order to file. While the information on these forms may assist in preparing a return, they are not required. Individual taxpayers should file their returns as they normally would.\nThe deadline for the Marketplace to provide Form 1095-A is January 31 of the year following the coverage year.\nThe IRS has posted a set of questions and answersabout the Forms 1095-B and 1095-C. The questions and answers explain who should expect to receive the forms, how they can be used, and how to file with or without the forms.\nquestions and answers\nIndividual shared responsibility provision\nFor tax year 2019 and later returns\nFor tax year 2019 and later returns\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the amount of the individual shared responsibility payment is reduced to zero for months beginning after December 31, 2018.\nBeginning in tax year 2019, Forms 1040 and 1040-SR will not have the full-year health care coverage or exempt box and Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, will no longer be used. You need not make a shared responsibility payment or file Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, with your tax return if you dont have a minimum essential coverage for part or all of the year.\nFor tax year 2018 and prior returns\nFor tax year 2018 and prior returns\nFor tax year 2018 and prior returns\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for all taxpayers to do at least one of three things:\nqualifying health insurance coverage\nexemption\nindividual shared responsibility payment\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, taxpayers must continue to report coverage, qualify for an exemption, or pay the individual shared responsibility payment for tax years 2017 and 2018.\nMost taxpayers are in the first category and have qualifying health insurance coverage for each month of the year. Theywill simply check a box on their return to indicate that everyone listed on the front of the return has qualifying health care coverage for the entire year. Some taxpayers will have to file a Form 8965PDF to claim an exemption from the requirement to have health care coverage.\nForm 8965\nPDF\nTaxpayers who do not have qualifying health care coverage and who do not qualify for an exemption will need to make an individual shared responsibility payment when they file their tax returns. Some taxpayers will find that they qualify for an exemption for part of the year but must make a payment for another part of the year. These taxpayers should pay close attention to guidance that covers their situation.\nAlmost all taxpayers must report health care coverage, claim a coverage exemption or report a shared responsibility payment. The IRS will not accept tax returns that do not reflect at least one of these options if filed electronically. If filed on paper, returns that do not reflect at least one of these options will take longer to process and any refunds will be delayed. Taxpayers should respond promptly to IRS correspondence about their health care coverage.\nExemptions for tax year 2018 and prior returns\nExemptions for tax year 2018 and prior returns\nExemptions for tax year 2018 and prior returns\nTaxpayers who did not maintain coverage throughout the year and meet certain criteria may be eligible to obtain an exemption from coverage.

Keep this notice with other important tax information and enter the ECN on Form 8965 in Part I, Marketplace-Granted Coverage Exemptions for Individuals. Individuals who applied for an exemption with the Marketplace but do not have an ECN may enter PENDING in Part I of Form 8965.

The IRS will reimburse people who have already repaid any excess APTC on their 2020 tax return. Taxpayers who received a letter about a missing Form 8962 should disregard the letter if they have excess APTC for 2020. The IRS will process tax returns without Form 8962 for tax year 2020 by reducing the excess APTC amount to zero.\nIf you have not filed your 2020 tax return, here's what to do:\nFor details see theTax Year 2020 Premium Tax Credit:\nFrequently Asked Questions\nFact Sheet\nNews Release\nIndividuals who purchase coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace may beeligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC). The Marketplace uses information individuals provide about their projected income, address, and family composition for the year to estimate the amount of APTC. Individuals can forgo APTC or have all or some of the APTC for which they are eligible paid directly to their insurer to lower their monthly premiums. For tax years 2021 and 2022, the ARPA temporarily expanded eligibility for the premium tax credit by eliminating the rule that a taxpayer is not allowed a premium tax credit if his or her household income is above 400% of the federal poverty line.\nHealth Insurance Marketplace\npremium tax credit (APTC\nFor tax years other than 2020, individuals who chose to have APTC sent to their insurer must file a federal income tax return, even if otherwise not required to file, and complete Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC)PDFPDFto claim the premium tax credit and reconcile the APTC with the premium tax credit allowed. If the taxpayers APTCis less than the premium tax credit, the taxpayer will get the difference, called net premium tax credit, as a higher refund or lower tax due. If the APTC paid to their health care providers were more than the premium tax credit (excess APTC), the taxpayer must pay all or part of the excess APTC with their tax return, except that this requirement to repay excess APTC does not apply for tax year 2020. The completed Form 8962 must be filed with the federal income tax return, except for taxpayers with excess APTC for 2020 who are not required to file Form 8962. For years other than 2020, filing your return without Form 8962 will delay your refund and may affect future APTC.\nForm 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC)\nPDF\nThose who enrolled in coverage through the Marketplace but didnt get the benefit of APTC may claim the premium tax credit when they file their return. Individuals can complete Form 8962 to find out if they are allowed the premium tax credit.

Beginning in July 2021, the IRS reviewed tax returns filed prior to the enactment of ARPA to identify tax returns on which both excludible unemployment compensation and excess APTC repayments were reported by the taxpayer. Taxpayers received letters from the IRS, generally within 30 days of the adjustment, informing them of what kind of adjustment was made (such as refund, payment of IRS debt payment or payment offset for other authorized debts) and the amount of the adjustment. For taxpayers who reported both excludible unemployment income and APTC, the adjustment should have covered both items even though the IRSs communication to the taxpayer may have mentioned only unemployment compensation.\nHowever, if, because of the excluded unemployment compensation, taxpayers are now eligible for deductions or credits not claimed on the original return, they should file a Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for tax year 2020.
