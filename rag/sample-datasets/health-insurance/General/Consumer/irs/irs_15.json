Information reporting also is integral to the administration of the premium tax credit. The IRS and any employee who does not enroll in an employer plan (but instead enrolls in coverage at the Health Insurance Marketplace) need information on the employers offer of coverage, including the cost of coverage, to determine whether that individual is eligible for the premium tax credit.\nAffected Employers\nThis information reporting provision requires an ALE to report information about health insurance coverage offered to its full-time employees (and their dependents). ALEs are required to report to the IRS, as well as to their full-time employees, regardless of whether the ALE actually offers health insurance coverage.\nFor more information about determining if an employer is an ALE, check our ALE page and our Questions and Answers.\nALE page\nQuestions and Answers\nControlled Group/Common Ownership\nCertain employer aggregation rules apply in determining whether an employer is an ALE subject to the employer information reporting provisions. Under those rules, all employers treated as a single employer under Internal Revenue Code section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as one employer for purposes of determining ALEstatus.The employers that comprise the Aggregated ALE Group are each referred to as ALE Members.\nThe employer information reporting requirements are applied separately to each Aggregated ALE Group Member comprising the ALE, consistent with the approach used to determine any assessable payment. For example, each ALE Member is liable for its own information reporting requirements, and is not liable for the information reporting requirements of any other entity in the controlled group comprising the Aggregated ALE Group.\nFor more information on the employer aggregation rules, see section V.D. of the preamble to the employer shared responsibility provision regulations, section 54.4980H-2 of the ESRP regulations and ESRP Q&As.\nsection V.D\n.\nsection 54.4980H-2\nESRP Q&As\nWhen to Report\nExtension of 2019 Due Dates:On November 29, 2018, the IRS extended the 2019 due datePDF for providing 2018 health coverage information forms to individuals.
