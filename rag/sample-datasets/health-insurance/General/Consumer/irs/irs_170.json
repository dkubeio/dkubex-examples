Your tax family consists of every individual you claim on your tax return yourself, your spouse if filing jointly, and your dependents.

If on your 2020 return you filed you reported excess APTC, or made an excess APTC repayment, and also reported unemployment compensation that is excludible under ARPA, you dont need to take any action to amend this reporting. Beginning in July 2021, the IRS reviewed tax returns filed prior to the enactment of ARPA to identify tax returns on which both excludible unemployment compensation and excess APTC repayments were reported by the taxpayer. Taxpayers received letters from the IRS, generally within 30 days of the adjustment, informing them of what kind of adjustment was made (such as a refund, payment of IRS debt payment or payment offset for other authorized debts) and the amount of the adjustment. For taxpayers who reported both excludible unemployment income and APTC, the adjustment should have covered both items even though the IRSs communication to the taxpayer may have mentioned only unemployment compensation.\nHowever, if, because of the excluded unemployment compensation, you are now eligible for deductions or credits not claimed on your original return, you should file a Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for tax year 2020.
