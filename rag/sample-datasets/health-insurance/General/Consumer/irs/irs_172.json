In general, the credit is available to small employers that pay at least half the cost of single coverage for their employees.\nThis credit provides a real boost to eligible small businesses by helping them afford health coverage for their employees, said IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman. We urge small businesses and tax-exempt employers to look closely at this important tax break  which is already effectiveto see if they qualify.\nThe maximum credit is 35 percent of premiums paid in 2010 by eligible small business employers and 25 percent of premiums paid by eligible employers that are tax-exempt organizations.In 2014, this maximum credit increases to 50 percent of premiums paid by eligible small business employers and 35 percent of premiums paid by eligible employers that are tax-exempt organizations.\nThe credit is specifically targeted to help small businesses and tax-exempt organizations that primarily employ low and moderate income workers. It is generally available to employers that have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees paying wages averaging less than $50,000 per employee per year. Because the eligibility formula is based in part on the number of FTEs, not the number of employees, many businesses will qualify even if they employ more than 25 individual workers.\nThe maximum credit goes to smaller employersthose with 10 or fewer FTEspaying annual average wages of $25,000 or less.\nEligible small businesses can claim the credit as part of the general business credit starting with the 2010 income tax return they file in 2011. For tax-exempt employers, the IRS will provide further information on how to claim the credit.\nThe IRS will use postcards to reach out to millions of small businesses that may qualify for the credit. The postcards will encourage small business owners to take advantage of the credit if they qualify.\nMore information about the credit, including tax tips, guidesPDFand answers tofrequently asked questions, is now available onthe IRS Web site, IRS.gov.\ntax tips\nguides\nPDF\nanswers tofrequently asked questions\nSubscribe to IRS Newswire\nSubscribe to IRS Newswire\n"}
