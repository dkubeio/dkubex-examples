The exemption is reported by entering your ECN in Part I of Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, in column C. If the Marketplace hasnt processed your exemption application before you file your tax return, complete Part I of Form 8965 and enter pending in Column C.\nYou do not need an ECN from the Marketplace for an exemption that you claim on your tax return.\nHow to claim coverage exemptions with the IRS\nIf your gross income or household income is below your filing threshold and you file a tax return, use Part II of Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, to claim a health coverage exemption.
