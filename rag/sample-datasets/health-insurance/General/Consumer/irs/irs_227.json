In addition, self-insured ALEs  that is, employers who sponsor self-insured group health plans  have additional provider information reporting requirements.\nEmployers must determine their ALE status each calendar year based on the average size of your workforce during the prior year.

While information on these forms may assist in preparing a return, the forms are not required to file. Taxpayers can prepare and file their returns using other information about their health coverage. They do not have to wait for Forms 1095-B or 1095-C to file.\nMore information is in Notice 2018-94PDF.\nNotice 2018-94\nPDF\nHow to Determine if you are an ALE\n\n\nIf an employer has at least 50 full-time employees, including full-time equivalent employees, on average during the prior year, the employer is an ALE for the current calendar year.
