How does IRC  7216 affect tax return preparers?\nA. The IRS takes the privacy rights of America's taxpayers very seriously and is committed to protecting those rights. Section 7216 prohibits tax return preparers, including those who also offer services and education related to the Affordable Care Act, from knowingly or recklessly disclosing or using tax return information for unauthorized purposes.\nThe tax return information a tax return preparer can disclose or use depends on whether the preparer obtains consent from the taxpayer, or whether Treas. Reg.  301.7216-2 provides an exception to the general prohibition on disclosure or use of tax return information without taxpayer consent.\nQ2. For tax return preparers, will taxpayer consent be required touse contact information to provide clients general educational information about the Affordable Care Act and health insurance available through the new health insurance marketplaces?\nA. No. The  7216 regulations permit tax return preparers to use a list of client names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and each clients income tax form number to provide clients general educational information, including general educational information related to the Affordable Care Act. For example, a tax return preparer may mail general educational information to all clients regarding health care enrollment options available through the new health insurance marketplaces without obtaining consent.\nQ3. Will taxpayer consent be required to solicit andfacilitate client enrollment in health insurance available through the new health insurance marketplaces?\nA. Yes.
