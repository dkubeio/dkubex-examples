The IRS-certified volunteers who provide tax counseling are often retired individuals associated with non-profit organizations that receive grants from the IRS.\nVITA/TCE services are not only free, they are also a reliable and trusted source for preparing tax returns. All VITA/TCE volunteers who prepare returns must take and pass tax law training that meets or exceeds IRS standards. This training includes maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of all taxpayer information. In addition to requiring volunteers to certify their knowledge of the tax laws, the IRS requires a quality review check for every return prepared at a VITA/TCE site prior to filing. Each filing season, tens of thousands of dedicated VITA/TCE volunteers prepare millions of federal and state returns. They also assist taxpayers with the preparation of thousands of Facilitated Self-Assistance returns.\nBefore your visit\nBefore going to a VITA or TCE site, see Publication 3676-BPDF for services provided and check out What to Bring to ensure you have all the required documents and information our volunteers will need to help you.\nPublication 3676-B\nPDF\nWhat to Bring\nNote: Available services can vary at each site due to the availability of volunteers certified with the tax law expertise required for your return.\nSome VITA sites offer CAA service to taxpayers along with their VITA program.\nCAA service\nAlso, visit the FDIC website for information on where to find a bank that can open an account online and how to choose the right account for you.\nFDIC website\nFind a VITA or TCE Site Near You\nVITA and TCE sites are generally located at community and neighborhood centers, libraries, schools, shopping malls and other convenient locations across the country.
