The IRS emphasized that this new reporting to employees is for their information only, to inform them of the cost of their health coverage, and does not cause excludable employer-provided health coverage to become taxable; employer-provided health coverage continues to be excludable from an employee's income, and is not taxable.\nThe Affordable Care Act provides that employers are required to report the cost of employer-provided health care coverage on the Form W-2.\nNotice 2010-69PDF, issued last fall, made this requirement optional for all employers for the 2011 Forms W-2 (generally furnished to employees in January 2012). In today's guidance, the IRS provided further relief for smaller employers (those filing fewer than 250 W-2 forms) by making this requirement optional for them at least for 2012 (i.e., for 2012 Forms W-2 that generally would be furnished to employees in January 2013) and continuing this optional treatment for smaller employers until further guidance is issued.\nNotice 2010-69\nPDF\nUsing a question-and-answer format, Notice 2011-28PDF also provides guidance for employers that are subject to this requirement for the 2012 Forms W-2 and those that choose to voluntarily comply with it for either 2011 or 2012. The notice includes information on how to report, what coverage to include and how to determine the cost of the coverage.\nNotice 2011-28\nPDF\nThe 2011 Form W-2, prior IRS Notice 2010-69PDF deferring the reporting requirement for 2011, and Notice 2011-28PDF containing the new guidance are available on IRS.gov.\nForm W-2\nNotice 2010-69\nPDF\nNotice 2011-28\nPDF\nRelated Items:\nEmployer-Provided Health Coverage Informational Reporting Requirements: Frequently Asked Questions\nFollow the IRS on New MediaSubscribe to IRS Newswire\nFollow the IRS on New Media\nSubscribe to IRS Newswire\n"}
