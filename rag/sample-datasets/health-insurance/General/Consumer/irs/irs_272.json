The law specifically exempts small firms that have fewer than 50 full-time employees. This provision takes effect in 2014.\nNotice 2011-36, posted today on IRS.gov, solicits public input and comment on several issues that will be the subject of future proposed guidance as Treasury and the IRS work to provide information to employers on how to comply with the shared responsibility provisions. In particular, the notice requests comment on possible approaches employers could use to determine who is a full-time employee.\nTodays request for comment is designed to ensure that Treasury and IRS continue to receive broad input from stakeholders on how best to implement the shared responsibility provisions in a way that is workable and administrable for employers, allowing them flexibility and minimizing burdens. Employers have asked for guidance on this provision, and a number of stakeholder groups have approached Treasury and IRS with information and initial suggestions, which have been taken into account in developing todays notice. By soliciting comments and feedback now, Treasury and IRS are giving all interested parties the opportunity for input before proposed regulations are issued at a later date.\nConsistent with the coordinated approach the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services are taking in developing the regulations and other guidance under the Affordable Care Act, the notice also solicits input on how the three Departments should interpret and apply the Acts provisions limiting the ability of plans and issuers to impose a waiting period for health coverage of longer than 90 days starting in 2014. In addition, the notice invites comment on how guidance under the 90-day provisions should be coordinated with the rules Treasury and IRS will propose regarding the shared responsibility provisions.\nThere are three ways to submit comments.\nNotice.Comments@irscounsel.treas.gov\nThe deadline for comments is June 17, 2011.\nFollow the IRS on New MediaSubscribe to IRS Newswire\nFollow the IRS on New Media\nSubscribe to IRS Newswire\n"}
