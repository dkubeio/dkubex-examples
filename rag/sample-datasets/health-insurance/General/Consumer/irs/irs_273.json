Notice 2011-73PDF, posted today on IRS.gov, solicits public input and comment on a proposed safe harbor, designed to make it easier for employers to determine whether the health coverage they offer is affordable. To that end, Treasury and IRS expect to propose a safe harbor permitting employers that offer coverage to their employees to measure the affordability of that coverage by using wages that the employer paid to an employee, instead of the employees household income. This contemplated safe harbor would only apply for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provision, and would not affect employees eligibility for health insurance premium tax credits.\nNotice 2011-73\nPDF\nTodays request for comment is designed to ensure that Treasury and IRS continue to receive broad input from stakeholders on how best to implement the shared responsibility provisions in a way that is administrable, allows flexibility, and minimizes burden. By soliciting comments and feedback now, Treasury and IRS are giving all interested parties the opportunity for input before proposed regulations are issued.\nThere are three ways to submit comments.\nNotice.Comments@irscounsel.treas.gov\nThe deadline for comments is December 13, 2011.\nFollow the IRS on New MediaSubscribe to IRS Newswire\nFollow the IRS on New Media\nSubscribe to IRS Newswire\n"}
