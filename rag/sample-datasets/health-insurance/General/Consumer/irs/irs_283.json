The agency stressed that the rest of the e-file system will continue to operate normally and urged all individuals and businesses to choose the accuracy, speed and convenience of electronic filing.\nIn general, the extension applies to tax-exempt organizations whose normal filing deadline is either Jan. 17 or Feb. 15, 2012. Ordinarily, these deadlines would apply to organizations with a fiscal year that ended on Aug. 31 or Sept. 30, 2011, respectively. The extension also applies to organizations that already obtained an initial three-month filing extension and now have an extended filing deadline that falls on Jan. 17 or Feb. 15, 2012. The majority of tax-exempt organizations will be unaffected by this extension because they operate on a calendar-year basis and have a May 15 filing deadline.\nThe extension applies to affected organizations filing Forms 990PDF, 990-EZPDF, 990-PFPDF, or 1120-POLPDF. Form 990-N filers will not be affected. No form needs to be filed to get the March 30 extension.\nForms 990\nPDF\n990-EZ\nPDF\n990-PF\nPDF\n1120-POL\nPDF\nIn order to avoid receiving a late filing penalty notice, a reasonable cause statement should be attached to the tax return. If organizations receive late-filing penalty notices, they should contact the IRS so that these penalties can be abated. The IRS encouraged these organizations to consider either e-filing early  before the end of December  or waiting until March to file electronically.\nFurther details are in Notice 2012-4PDF, posted today on IRS.gov.\nNotice 2012-4\nPDF\nFollow the IRS on New MediaSubscribe to IRS Newswire\nFollow the IRS on New Media\nSubscribe to IRS Newswire\n"}
