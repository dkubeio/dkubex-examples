These include a 2013 tax credit estimator, examples of typical tax savings under various scenarios and answers to frequently-asked questions.\nSmall Business Health Care Tax Credit\nestimator\nAdditionally, the IRS has Health Care Tax Tips, designed to provide useful information to employers, families and individuals. These tips include a new Small Business Health Care Tax Credit tip as well as tips covering other Affordable Care Act topics.\nHealth Care Tax Tips\nThe small business health care tax credit was included in the Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010. Under the ACA, eligible small employers can claim the credit for 2010 through 2013 and for two additional years beginning in 2014. For 2010 through 2013, the maximum credit is 35 percent of premiums paid by eligible small businesses and 25 percent of premiums paid by eligible tax-exempt organizations. In 2014, the maximum credit rate rises to 50 percent for small businesses and 35 percent for tax-exempt organizations.\nSmall employers that pay at least half of the premiums for employee health insurance coverage under a qualifying arrangement may be eligible for this credit. The credit is specifically targeted to help small businesses and tax-exempt organizations provide health insurance for their employees.\nDepending upon how they are structured, eligible small employers are likely subject to one of the following three tax-filing deadlines, which fall in coming weeks:\nForm 8941\nForm 1065\nPDF\nForm 1040\nForm 990-T\nTaxpayers needing more time to determine eligibility should consider obtaining an automatic tax-filing extension, usually for six months. See Form 4868 for individuals, Form 7004 for businesses and Form 8868 for tax-exempt organizations.\nForm 4868\nForm 7004\nForm 8868\nBusinesses that have already filed and later find that they qualified in 2013 or an earlier year can still claim the credit by filing an amended return for the affected years. Corporations use Form 1120X, individuals use Form 1040X and tax-exempt organizations use Form 990-T. A three-year statute of limitations normally applies to these refund claims. See the instructions to these forms for details.\nForm 1120X\nForm 1040X\nSome businesses and tax-exempt organizations that already locked into health insurance plan structures and contributions may not have had the opportunity to make any needed adjustments to qualify for the credit for 2013 or earlier years. These employers can still make changes so they qualify to claim the credit on future returns.\nTo learn more about the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit and view tips about other ACA topics, visit the Health Care Tax Tip page on IRS.gov/aca.
