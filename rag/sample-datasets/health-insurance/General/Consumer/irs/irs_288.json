Because Notice 2013-45 provides transition relief for section 6055 reporting for 2014, the first section 6055 returns required to be filed are for the 2015 calendar year and must be filed no later than February 29, 2016, or March 31, 2016, if filed electronically. However, see Extended Due Dates and Transition Reliefregarding an extension of these dates for 2015 reporting due in 2016. The due dates for filing for 2016 and 2017 were not extended.\nExtended Due Dates and Transition Relief\nRegulations under section 6081 address extensions of time to file information returns. Under these regulations, health coverage providers may claim an automatic 30-day extension of time for filing information returns by submitting a Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time To File Information Returns. Under certain conditions, providers may also request additional extensions of time to file. For additional information see the instructions for Forms 1094-B and 1095-BPDF.\nForm 8809,\ninstructions for Forms 1094-B and 1095-B\nPDF\n20.What type of return must a health coverage provider file with the IRS?\nGenerally, a health coverage provider must file Form 1094-B and Form 1095-B (or other form that IRS designates, or a substitute form).However, if the provider is also an ALE Member as defined in the employer shared responsibility provisions under section 4980H and provides coverage to its employees through a self-insured group health plan, the provider must file Form 1094-C and Form 1095-C (or other form that IRS designates, or a substitute form), instead of Forms 1094-B and 1095-B, to report information with respect to its employees. For further information about the employer shared responsibility provisions and who is an ALE member, see the section 4980H final regulations and our section 4980H questions and answers. For further information about the forms, see the instructions for Forms 1094-B and 1095-BPDF, the instructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-CPDFand the questions and answers about Forms 1094-C and 1095-C.\nsection 4980H final regulations\nsection 4980H questions and answers\ninstructions for Forms 1094-B and 1095-B\nPDF\ninstructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-C\nPDF\nquestions and answers about Forms 1094-C and 1095-C\n21.Must a health coverage provider file the return with the IRS electronically?\nA health coverage provider that is required to file 250 or more Forms 1095-B or 250 or more Forms 1095-C during the calendar year must file the returns electronically.The 250 return threshold applies separately to each type of return required to be filed.Only Forms 1095-B or 1095-C are counted in applying the 250 return threshold for section 6055 reporting. However, if the 250 return threshold applies, Forms 1094-B and 1094-C also must be filed electronically. A provider that is required to file fewer than 250 Forms 1095-B or Forms 1095-C may file on paper or electronically.\n22.To whom must a health coverage provider furnish the statement?\nA health coverage provider must furnish the statement to a responsible individual.The responsible individual generally is the person who enrolls one or more individuals, which may include him or herself, in minimum essential coverage.The responsible individual may be the primary insured, employee, former employee, uniformed services sponsor, parent, or other related person named on the coverage application.\n23.Must a health coverage provider furnish the statement to anyone who is not the responsible individual?\nNo.A provider is not required to provide a statement to any individual who is not the responsible individual.\n24.When must a health coverage provider furnish the statement to the responsible individual?\nA health coverage provider generallymust furnish the statement to the responsible individual on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which minimum essential coverage is provided.If the provider applies to the IRS in writing and shows good cause, the IRS may grant an extension of time up to 30 days for the provider to furnish the statement.\nHowever, see Extended Due Dates and Transition Reliefregarding an extension of these dates for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018for Forms 1095-B due in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019,respectively.\nExtended Due Dates and Transition Relief\n25.How must a health coverage provider furnish the statement to the responsible individual?\nA health coverage provider generally must mail the statement to the responsible individuals last known permanent address or, if no permanent address is known, to the individuals temporary address.A providers first class mailing to the last known permanent address, or if no permanent address is known, the temporary address, discharges the providers requirement to furnish the statement.\nA health coverage provider also may furnish the statement electronically to the responsible individual if the responsible individual affirmatively consents to it.\n26.Does an employer that must file returns under section 6055 as a provider of self-insured health coverage to its employees and under section 6056 as an applicable large employer file combined information returns and statements?\nYes.An ALE Member, as defined in the employer shared responsibility provisions under section 4980H, that provides self-insured coverage is subject to the reporting requirements of both section 6055 and section 6056.To streamline and prevent duplication under each reporting requirement, ALE Members with self-insured coverage will combine section 6055 and section 6056 reporting.An ALE Member with self-insured coverage will report on Form 1095-C, completing separate sections to report the information required under sections 6055 and 6056.An ALE Member that provides insured coverage will complete only the section of Form 1095-C that reports the information required under section 6056.Entities reporting as health insurance issuers, sponsors of self-insured group health plans that are not applicable large employers, sponsors of multi-employer plans, and providers of government-sponsored coverage, will report under section 6055 on Form 1094-B and Form 1095-B.\nFor further information about the employer shared responsibility provisions under section 4980H and the reporting requirements under section 6056, see the section 4980H final regulations, our section 4980H questions and answers, the section 6056 final regulations, and our section 6056 questions and answers.

However, entering into a reporting arrangement does not transfer the potential liability of the provider for failure to report information and furnish statements under section 6055.In addition, if a person who prepares returns or statements under section 6055 is a tax return preparer, that person will be subject to the requirements generally applicable to tax return preparers.\n28.For information returns filed and furnished in 2017 for coverage provided in 2016 and later years, what penalties may apply if a health coverage provider fails to comply with the section 6055 information reporting requirements?\nThe penalty under section 6721 may apply to a provider that fails to file timely information returns, fails to include all the required information, or includes incorrect information on the return.The penalty under section 6722 may apply to a provider that fails to furnish timely the statement, fails to include all the required information, or includes incorrect information on the statement. The waiver of penalty and special rules under section 6724 and the applicable regulations, including abatement of information return penalties for reasonable cause, may apply to certain failures under section 6721 or 6722. See Extended Due Dates and Transition Relief for information on relief that applies with respect to these penalties for reporting and furnishing for 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.\nExtended Due Dates and Transition Relief\nBack to top\nBack to top\nExtended Due Dates and Transition Relief\nExtended Due Dates and Transition Relief\n29.Were the due dates for filing and furnishing 2018 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B extended?\nIRS has extended the 2019 due date for furnishing 2018 Forms 1095-B to individuals, but has not extended the due date for filing the 2018 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B with the IRS. Specifically, Notice 2018-94PDF extended the due date for furnishing the 2017 Form 1095-B to individuals, from January 31, 2019, until March 4, 2019.\nNotice 2018-94\nPDF\nThe extension applies automatically and does not require the submission of any request or other documentation to the IRS. In view of this automatic extension, the rules allowing the IRS to grant extensions of time of up to 30 days to furnish Form 1095-B will not apply to the extended due date. Also, because the 30-day extension of the due date to furnish applies automatically and is as generous as the permissive 30-day extensions of time to furnish 2018 information statements under section 6055 that have already been requested by some reporting entities in submissions to the IRS, the IRS will not formally respond to those requests.\nUnder Notice 2018-94, the extended furnishing due date also applies for purposes of section 6056 reporting for 2018 (Forms 1094-C and 1095-C).\nAlthough IRS has not extended the due date for filing 2018 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B with the IRS, note that Notice 2018-94 does not affect the normal provisions regarding automatic extensions of time for filing information returns, which can be obtained by submitting a Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time To File Information Returns, and it also does not affect the provisions regarding additional extensions of time to file.\n30.\nFor the 2018 information reporting requirements, did Notice 2018-94 affect the rules under sections 6721(b) and 6722(b) concerning the reduction of penalty amounts for reporting under section 6055 or 6056?\nNo. Notice 2018-94 did not affect the rules under sections 6721(b) and 6722(b) concerning the reduction of penalty amounts for 2018 reporting under section 6055 or 6056.\n31.Were the due dates for filing and furnishing 2017 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B extended?\nIRS has extended the 2018 due date for furnishing 2017 Forms 1095-B to individuals, but has not extended the due date for filing the 2017 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B with the IRS. Specifically, Notice 2018-06 PDFextended the due date for furnishing the 2017 Form 1095-B to individuals, from January 31, 2018, until March 2, 2018.\nNotice 2018-06 \nPDF\nThe extension applies automatically and does not require the submission of any request or other documentation to the IRS. In view of this automatic extension, the rules allowing the IRS to grant extensions of time of up to 30 days to furnish Form 1095-B will not apply to the extended due date. Also, because the 30-day extension of the due date to furnish applies automatically and is as generous as the permissive 30-day extensions of time to furnish 2017 information statements under section 6055 that have already been requested by some reporting entities in submissions to the IRS, the IRS will not formally respond to those requests.\nUnder Notice 2018-06, the extended furnishing due date also applies for purposes of section 6056 reporting for 2017 (Forms 1094-C and 1095-C).\nAlthough IRS has not extended the due date for filing 2017 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B with the IRS, note that Notice 2018-06 does not affect the normal provisions regarding automatic extensions of time for filing information returns, which can be obtained by submitting a Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time To File Information Returns, and it also does not affect the provisions regarding additional extensions of time to file.\n32.For the 2017 information reporting requirements, did Notice 2018-06 affect the rules under sections 6721(b) and 6722(b) concerning the reduction of penalty amounts for reporting under section 6055 or 6056?\nNo. Notice 2018- 06did not affect the rules under sections 6721(b) and 6722(b) concerning the reduction of penalty amounts for 2017 reporting under section 6055 or 6056.\n33.Were the due dates for filing and furnishing 2016 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B extended?\nIRS extended the 2017 due date for furnishing 2016 Forms 1095-B to individuals, but has not extended the due date for filing the 2016 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B with the IRS. Specifically, Notice 2016-70 extended the due date for furnishing the 2016 Form 1095-B to individuals, from January 31, 2017, until March 2, 2017.\nThe extension applies automatically and does not require the submission of any request or other documentation to the IRS. In view of this automatic extension, the rules allowing the IRS to grant extensions of time of up to 30 days to furnish Form 1095-B will not apply to the extended due date.\nUnder Notice 2016-70, the extended furnishing due date also applies for purposes of section 6056 reporting for 2016 (Forms 1094-C and 1095-C).\n34.For the 2016 information reporting requirements, did Notice 2016-70 affect the rules of sections 6721(b) and 6722(b) concerning the reduction of penalty amounts for reporting under section 6055 or 6056?\nNo. Notice 2016-70 did not affect the rules under sections 6721(b) and 6722(b) concerning the reduction of penalty amounts for 2016 reporting under section 6055 or 6056.\n35. Were the due dates for filing and furnishing 2015 Forms 1094-B and 1095-B extended?\nYes. In Notice 2016-4PDF, IRS extended the 2016 due dates for the 2015 information reporting requirements, for both filing information returns with the IRS and furnishing statements to individuals, for insurers, self-insured employers, and other coverage providers under section 6055, and for ALE Members under section 6056.\nNotice 2016-4\nPDF\nSpecifically, Notice 2016-4 extended the due date for furnishing to individuals the 2015 Forms 1095-B from January 31, 2016, until March 31, 2016, and extended the due date for filing with the IRS the 2015 Forms 1094-B, 1095-B, 1094-C, and 1095-C from February 29, 2016, to May 31, 2016, if not filing electronically, and from March 31, 2016, to June 30, 2016, if filing electronically.\nThese extensions applied automatically and were not longer than the 30-day extensions that could otherwise be obtained. Therefore, the IRS did not process any previously requested extensions of these deadlines for 2015 reporting in 2016. Employers or coverage providers that did not comply with the extended due dates in Notice 2016-4 may be subject to penalties under section 6722 or 6721 for failure to timely furnish and file.\n36. For the 2015 information reporting requirements, did Notice 2016-04 affect the rules of sections 6721(b) and 6722(b) concerning the reduction of penalty amounts for reporting under section 6055 or 6056?\nYes. Because the deadlines under sections 6055 and 6056 for furnishing ACA statements to individuals and filing ACA information returns with IRS were extended as described above, the August 1, 2016 deadlines for reduction in penalty amounts to correct the failures described in sections 6721(a)(2) and 6722(a)(2) also were extended.\nFor statements furnished to individuals under sections 6055 and 6056, any failures that issuers correct by April 30 and October 1, 2016, respectively, will be subject to reduced penalties. For returns filed on paper with the IRS under sections 6055 and 6056, any failures that issuers correct by June 30 or November 1, 2016, respectively, will be subject to reduced penalties. For returns filed electronically with the IRS under sections 6055 and 6056, any failures that issuers correct by July 30 or November 1, 2016, respectively, will be subject to reduced penalties.\nThese extended dates have no effect on the penalty relief described below for incomplete or incorrect returns filed or statements furnished to covered individuals in 2016 for coverage provided in calendar year 2015. However, the IRS has publicly stated in various forums that filers of Forms 1094-B, 1095-B, 1094-C, and 1095-C that missed the June 30, 2016, due date will not generally be assessed late filing penalties under section 6721 if the reporting entity made legitimate efforts to register with the AIR system and to file its information returns, and it continued to make such efforts and completed the process as soon as possible. In addition, consistent with existing information reporting rules, filers that are assessed penalties may still meet the criteria for a reasonable cause waiver from the penalties.\n37.Is relief available from penalties for incomplete or incorrect returns filed or statements furnished to covered individuals in 2016 (for coverage in 2015), 2017 (for coverage in 2016), 2018 (for coverage in 2017), \nand 2019 (for coverage in 2018)\n?\nYes. In implementing new information reporting requirements, short-term relief from reporting penalties frequently is provided. This relief generally allows additional time to develop appropriate procedures for collection of data and compliance with the new reporting requirements. Accordingly, for reporting in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019for coverage provided in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018respectively, the IRS will not impose penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 on reporting entities that can show that they have made good faith efforts to comply with the information reporting requirements.\nSpecifically, relief is provided from penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 for returns and statements filed and furnished in 2016 to report coverage in 2015, and in 2017 to report coverage in 2016, in 2018 to report coverage in 2017, and in 2019 to report coverage in 2018,for incorrect or incomplete information reported on the return or statement. For example, a group health plan insurer that makes a reasonable effort to obtain the EIN of the employer sponsoring the coverage will not be subject to penalties under sections 6721 or 6722 if the insurer fails to enter an EIN on line 11 of Form 1095-B for 2015 or enters an EIN that is found to be incorrect. No relief is provided in the case of reporting entities that cannot show a good faith effort to comply with the information reporting requirements or that fail to timely file an information return or furnish a statement. However, consistent with the existing information reporting rules, reporting entities that fail to timely meet the requirements still may be eligible for penalty relief if the IRS determines that the standards for reasonable cause under section 6724 are satisfied.\nBack to top\nBack to top\n"}
