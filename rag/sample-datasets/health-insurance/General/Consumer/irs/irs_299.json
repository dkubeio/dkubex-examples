Calculate Additional Medicare Tax on any wages in excess of the applicable threshold for the filing status, without regard to whether any tax was withheld.\nStep 2. Reduce the applicable threshold for the filing status by the total amount of Medicare wages received, but not below zero.\nStep 3. Calculate Additional Medicare Tax on any self-employment income in excess of the reduced threshold.\nExample 1. C, a single filer, has $130,000 in wages and $145,000 in self-employment income.\nExample 2. D and E are married and file jointly. D has $150,000 in wages and E has $175,000 in self-employment income.\nExample 3. F, who is married filing separate, has $175,000 in wages and $50,000 in self-employment income.\nExample 4.

The threshold applicable to an individuals filing status is applied separately to each of these categories of income.\nExample.J and K, are married and file jointly.J has $190,000 in wages subject to Medicare tax and K has $150,000 in compensation subject to RRTA taxes. J and K do not combine their wages and RRTA compensation to determine whether they are in excess of the $250,000 threshold for a joint return.J and K are not liable to pay Additional Medicare Tax because Js wages are not in excess of the $250,000 threshold and Ks RRTA compensation is not in excess of the $250,000 threshold.\nHow do individuals calculate Additional Medicare Tax if they have compensation subject to RRTA taxes and self-employment income subject to SECA tax?\nHow do individuals calculate Additional Medicare Tax if they have compensation subject to RRTA taxes and self-employment income subject to SECA tax?\nThe threshold applicable to an individuals filing status is applied separately to RRTA compensation and self-employment income.

F and G are married and file jointly.F has $160,000 in self-employment income and G has $140,000 in compensation subject to RRTA taxes. The $140,000 of RRTA compensation does not reduce the threshold at which Additional Medicare Tax applies to self-employment income. F and G are not liable to pay Additional Medicare Tax because F's self-employment income is not in excess of the $250,000 threshold and Gs RRTA compensation is not in excess of the $250,000 threshold.\n\nCommunity Property\nHow does a married filing separate spouse in a community property state calculate Additional Medicare Tax on wages subject to FICA tax and self-employment income subject to SECA tax?\nHow does a married filing separate spouse in a community property state calculate Additional Medicare Tax on wages subject to FICA tax and self-employment income subject to SECA tax?\nIndividuals who are married filing separate spouses in a community property state will calculate their Additional Medicare Tax liability, using the married filing separate threshold amount of $125,000, without regard to the income tax treatment of the community property income:\nExample. A and B live in a community property state and are married filing separate. A has $200,000 in wages and B has $100,000 in self employment income. A is liable for Additional Medicare Tax on $75,000, the amount by which As wages exceed the $125,000 threshold for married filing separate. Bs self-employment income of $100,000 does not exceed the $125,000 threshold, so B does not owe Additional Medicare Tax.\nHow do married filing separate spouses living in a community property state determine their credit for Additional Medicare Tax withheld on wages, their credit for income tax withholding or their credit for estimated tax payments?\nHow do married filing separate spouses living in a community property state determine their credit for Additional Medicare Tax withheld on wages, their credit for income tax withholding or their credit for estimated tax payments?\nThe credit for any Additional Medicare Tax withheld on wages applies only to the wage earner. However, in community property states, half of any income tax withholding on one spouses wages will be credited to the other spouse. By contrast, each spouse can take full credit for the estimated tax payments that he or she made. However, if married filing separate spouses made joint estimated tax payments, either spouse can claim all of the estimated tax paid, or they may agree to divide it between them. If they cannot agree on how to divide it, each spouse may claim credit for the portion of the estimated tax payments that equals the total estimated tax paid times the tax shown on the spouses separate return, divided by the combined total of the tax shown on both spouses returns.\nAs a result, an individual living in a community property state who is a married filing separate spouse and who anticipates Additional Medicare Tax liability should be aware that the credit for any additional income tax withholding will be split between both spouses but that estimated tax payments can be fully claimed by the spouse who made them or, if made jointly, divided between them as agreed or in proportion to their tax liability.\nExample. C and D are married filing separate spouses living in a community property state. C has $150,000 in self-employment income and D has $240,000 in wages. C is liable for Additional Medicare Tax on $25,000 of self-employment income, the amount by which Cs self-employment income exceeds the $125,000 threshold for married filing separate. D is liable for Additional Medicare Tax on $115,000 of wages, the amount by which Ds wages exceed the $125,000 married filing separate threshold. Ds employer will only withhold Additional Medicare Tax on the amount of Ds wages that exceed $200,000, in this case $40,000. D must pay the remaining Additional Medicare Tax liability on $75,000 through increased income tax withholding, estimated tax payments, or payment with Ds income tax return. If D requests additional federal income tax withholding, half of this additional withholding must be credited to C. However, if D makes estimated tax payments, these payments will be credited entirely to D. If C and D make joint estimated tax payments, these payments may be divided between them as agreed or in proportion to their tax liability.\nHow does a registered domestic partner (RDP) who is subject to his or her states community property laws calculate Additional Medicare Tax on wages subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax and self-employment income subject to Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) tax?\nHow does a registered domestic partner (RDP) who is subject to his or her states community property laws calculate Additional Medicare Tax on wages subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax and self-employment income subject to Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) tax?\nRegistered domestic partners (RDPs) are not married for federal tax purposes so they can only use the single filing status or, if they qualify, the head of household status.Thus, their threshold for Additional Medicare Tax is $200,000. Individuals who are RDPs in a community property state will calculate their Additional Medicare Tax liability as follows:\nExample 1: E and F are RDPs who are subject to their states community property laws.E has $150,000 in wages and F has $125,000 in wages. Since neither E nor F has wages that exceed the threshold of $200,000, neither E nor F owes Additional Medicare Tax.\nExample 2: G and H are RDPs who are subject to their states community property laws. G has $300,000 in wages and H has $100,000 in self-employment income.G and H must each calculate Additional Medicare Tax on half of Hs self-employment income.G will calculate Additional Medicare Tax on $300,000 in wages and $50,000 in self-employment income.Gs wages exceed the $200,000 threshold amount by $100,000, so G is liable for Additional Medicare Tax on $100,000 in wages.Before calculating the Additional Medicare Tax on self-employment income, Gs $200,000 threshold is reduced by Gs $300,000 in wages (but not below zero), resulting in a reduced self-employment income threshold for G of $0.G is therefore also liable for Additional Medicare Tax on $50,000 in self-employment income.\nH calculates Additional Medicare Tax only on $50,000 in self-employment income (half of Hs total self-employment income).Since $50,000 is below Hs $200,000 threshold, H does not owe Additional Medicare Tax.\nHow does a registered domestic partner (RDP) who is subject to his or her states community property laws determine the credit for Additional Medicare Tax withheld on wages, the credit for income tax withholding, or the credit for estimated tax payments?\nHow does a registered domestic partner (RDP) who is subject to his or her states community property laws determine the credit for Additional Medicare Tax withheld on wages, the credit for income tax withholding, or the credit for estimated tax payments?\nThe credit for any Additional Medicare Tax withheld on wages applies only to the wage earner. However, in community property states, half of any income tax withholding on wages will be credited to the other RDP.By contrast, each RDP takes full credit for the estimated tax payments that he or she made.RDPs cannot make joint estimated tax payments.\nAs a result, an individual in a community property state who is an RDP and who anticipates Additional Medicare Tax liability should be aware that the credit for any additional income tax withholding will be split between both RDPs but that estimated tax payments are fully claimed by the RDP who made them.\nExample: J and K are RDPs who are subject to their states community property laws.J has $250,000 in wages and K has $50,000 in self-employment income.Because half of Ks self-employment income must be reported by J for Additional Medicare Tax purposes, J is liable for Additional Medicare Tax on $50,000 of wages and $25,000 of self-employment income.However, Js employer will only withhold Additional Medicare Tax on the amount of Js wages that exceed $200,000, in this case $50,000.J must pay the remaining Additional Medicare Tax liability on $25,000 through increased income tax withholding, estimated tax payments, or payment with Js income tax return.If J decides to increase federal income tax withholding to cover the liability, half of this additional withholding must be credited to K.However, if J makes estimated tax payments, these payments will be credited entirely to J.\nK calculates Additional Medicare Tax only on $25,000 in self-employment income (half of Ks total self-employment income).Since $25,000 is below Ks $200,000 threshold, K does not owe Additional Medicare Tax.\n\nReporting Additional Medicare Tax\nHow do I report Additional Medicare Tax when I file my tax return?\nHow do I report Additional Medicare Tax when I file my tax return?\nHow do I report Additional Medicare Tax when I file my tax return?\nYou will report Additional Medicare Tax on Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax, and attach Form 8959 to your income tax return.\nWho is required to file Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax?\nWho is required to file Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax?\nWho is required to file Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax?\nIf you are liable for Additional Medicare Tax and/or your employer withheld Additional Medicare Tax from your wages or compensation, you must file Form 8959.\nIf your Medicare wages and tips on all Forms W-2, Wage & Tax Statement, plus self-employment income - combined with your spouses Medicare wages and tips and self-employment income if youre filing a joint return - are more than the threshold amount for your filing status on the chart in FAQ #3, you are liable for Additional Medicare Tax on the amount that exceeds the threshold.

Withholding rules for this tax are different than the income tax withholding rules for supplemental wages in excess of $1,000,000 as explained in Publication 15, section 7.\nExample. M received $180,000 in wages through Nov. 30, 2013. On December 1, 2013, Ms employer paid her a bonus of $50,000. Ms employer is required to withhold Additional Medicare Tax on $30,000 of the $50,000 bonus and may not withhold Additional Medicare Tax on the other $20,000. M's employer also must withhold Additional Medicare Tax on any other wages paid in December 2013.\nI have two employees who are married to each other. Each earns $150,000, so I know that their combined wages will exceed the threshold applicable to married couples that file jointly. Do I need to withhold Additional Medicare tax?\nI have two employees who are married to each other. Each earns $150,000, so I know that their combined wages will exceed the threshold applicable to married couples that file jointly. Do I need to withhold Additional Medicare tax?\nI have two employees who are married to each other. Each earns $150,000, so I know that their combined wages will exceed the threshold applicable to married couples that file jointly. Do I need to withhold Additional Medicare tax?\nNo. An employer does not combine wages it pays to two employees to determine whether to withhold Additional Medicare Tax. An employer is required to withhold Additional Medicare Tax only when it pays wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year to an employee.\nWhat should an employer do if an employee receives wages that are not paid in cash, such as taxable fringe benefits, from which Additional Medicare Tax cannot be withheld?\nWhat should an employer do if an employee receives wages that are not paid in cash, such as taxable fringe benefits, from which Additional Medicare Tax cannot be withheld?\nWhat should an employer do if an employee receives wages that are not paid in cash, such as taxable fringe benefits, from which Additional Medicare Tax cannot be withheld?\nIf an employee receives wages from an employer in excess of $200,000 and the wages include taxable noncash fringe benefits, the employer calculates wages for purposes of withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the same way that it calculates wages for withholding Medicare tax.The employer is required to withhold Additional Medicare Tax on total wages, including taxable noncash fringe benefits, in excess of $200,000.The value of taxable noncash fringe benefits must be included in wages and the employer must withhold the applicable Additional Medicare Tax and deposit the tax under the rules for employment tax withholding and deposits that apply to taxable noncash fringe benefits. Additional information on how to withhold tax on taxable noncash fringe benefits is available in Publication 15 (Circular E), section 5, and Publication 15-B, section 4.\nIf an employee receives tips and other wages in excess of $200,000 in the calendar year, how is Additional Medicare Tax paid on the tips?\nIf an employee receives tips and other wages in excess of $200,000 in the calendar year, how is Additional Medicare Tax paid on the tips?\nIf an employee receives tips and other wages in excess of $200,000 in the calendar year, how is Additional Medicare Tax paid on the tips?\nTo the extent that tips and other wages exceed $200,000, an employer applies the same withholding rules for Additional Medicare Tax as it does currently for Medicare tax.An employer withholds Additional Medicare Tax on the employees reported tips from wages it pays to the employee.\nIf the employee does not receive enough wages for the employer to withhold all the taxes that the employee owes, including Additional Medicare Tax, the employee may give the employer money to pay the rest of the taxes. If the employee does not give the employer money to pay the taxes, then the employer makes a current period adjustment on Form 941, Employers QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return (or the employers applicable employment tax return), to reflect any uncollected employee social security, Medicare, or Additional Medicare Tax on reported tips. Uncollected taxes are not reported in boxes 4 and 6 of Form W-2. Unlike the uncollected portion of the regular (1.45%) Medicare tax, the uncollected Additional Medicare Tax is not reported in box 12 of Form W-2 with code B.\nThe employee may need to make estimated tax payments to cover any shortage.More information about this process of giving an employer money for taxes is available in Publication 531, Reporting Tip Income.\nIf a former employee receives group-term life insurance coverage in excess of $50,000 and the cost of the coverage, in combination with other wages, exceeds $200,000, how does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on this?\nIf a former employee receives group-term life insurance coverage in excess of $50,000 and the cost of the coverage, in combination with other wages, exceeds $200,000, how does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on this?\nIf a former employee receives group-term life insurance coverage in excess of $50,000 and the cost of the coverage, in combination with other wages, exceeds $200,000, how does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on this?\nThe imputed cost of coverage in excess of $50,000 is subject to social security and Medicare taxes, and to the extent that, in combination with other wages, it exceeds $200,000, it is also subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding.However, when group-term life insurance over $50,000 is provided to an employee (including retirees) after his or her termination, the employee share of Social Security and Medicare taxes and Additional Medicare Tax on that period of coverage is paid by the former employee with his or her tax return and is not collected by the employer.In this case, an employer should report this income as wages on Form 941, Employers QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return (or the employers applicable employment tax return), and make a current period adjustment to reflect any uncollected employee social security, Medicare, or Additional Medicare Tax on group-term life insurance. Uncollected taxes are not reported in boxes 4 and 6 of Form W-2. Unlike the uncollected portion of the regular (1.45%) Medicare tax, an employer may not report the uncollected Additional Medicare Tax in box 12 of Form W-2 with code N.\nFor employees who receive third-party sick pay, will wages paid by an employer and by the third party need to be aggregated to determine whether the $200,000 withholding threshold has been met?\nFor employees who receive third-party sick pay, will wages paid by an employer and by the third party need to be aggregated to determine whether the $200,000 withholding threshold has been met?\nFor employees who receive third-party sick pay, will wages paid by an employer and by the third party need to be aggregated to determine whether the $200,000 withholding threshold has been met?\nYes. Wages paid by an employer and by the third party need to be aggregated to determine whether the $200,000 withholding threshold has been met. The same rules that currently assign responsibility for sick pay reporting and payment of Medicare tax based on which party is treated as the employer (that is, the employer, the employers agent, or a third party that is not the employers agent) apply also to Additional Medicare Tax. For more information on sick pay, see Publication 15-A, Employers Supplemental Tax Guide, and Notice 91-26, 1991-2 C.B. 619.\nIf an employee has amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan, when is the nonqualified deferred compensation taken into account as wages for purposes of withholding Additional Medicare Tax?\nIf an employee has amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan, when is the nonqualified deferred compensation taken into account as wages for purposes of withholding Additional Medicare Tax?\nIf an employee has amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan, when is the nonqualified deferred compensation taken into account as wages for purposes of withholding Additional Medicare Tax?\nAn employer calculates wages for purposes of withholding Additional Medicare Tax from nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) in the same way that it calculates wages for withholding the existing Medicare tax from NQDC. Thus, if an employee has amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and the NQDC is taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes under the special timing rule described in 31.3121(v)(2)-1(a)(2) of the Employment Tax Regulations, the NQDC would likewise be taken into account under the special timing rule for purposes of determining an employers obligation to withhold Additional Medicare Tax. Additional information about the special timing rules for NQDC is in Publication 957, Reporting Back Pay and Special Wage Payments to the Social Security Administration.\nFor a company that goes through a merger or acquisition, will the wages from the predecessor and successor employers be combined to determine whether the $200,000 withholding threshold has been met?\nFor a company that goes through a merger or acquisition, will the wages from the predecessor and successor employers be combined to determine whether the $200,000 withholding threshold has been met?\nFor a company that goes through a merger or acquisition, will the wages from the predecessor and successor employers be combined to determine whether the $200,000 withholding threshold has been met?\nWhen corporate acquisitions meet certain requirements, wages paid by the predecessor are treated as if paid by the successor for purposes of applying the social security wage base and for applying the Additional Medicare Tax withholding threshold (that is, $200,000 in a calendar year). For more information on acquisitions under the predecessor-successor rules, see Rev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320; Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations; and the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941).\nRev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320\nShould an employer combine an employees wages for services performed for all of its subsidiaries if it has an employee who performs services for more than one subsidiary in its company, but the payroll is paid through one of the subsidiaries?\nShould an employer combine an employees wages for services performed for all of its subsidiaries if it has an employee who performs services for more than one subsidiary in its company, but the payroll is paid through one of the subsidiaries?\nShould an employer combine an employees wages for services performed for all of its subsidiaries if it has an employee who performs services for more than one subsidiary in its company, but the payroll is paid through one of the subsidiaries?\nAn employer is required to withhold Additional Medicare Tax on wages paid to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. When an employee is performing services for multiple subsidiaries of a company, and each subsidiary is an employer of the employee with regard to the services the employee performs for that subsidiary, the wages paid by the payor on behalf of each subsidiary should be combined only if the payor is a common paymaster. Publication 15-A, section 7 contains more information on common paymasters. The wages are not combined for purposes of the $200,000 withholding threshold if the payor is not a common paymaster.\nI am a common paymaster that pays wages to an employee who is concurrently employed by related corporations. Should I combine this employee's wages for purposes of determining whether wages are paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold? \nI am a common paymaster that pays wages to an employee who is concurrently employed by related corporations. Should I combine this employee's wages for purposes of determining whether wages are paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold? \nI am a common paymaster that pays wages to an employee who is concurrently employed by related corporations. Should I combine this employee's wages for purposes of determining whether wages are paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold? \nYes. Liability to withhold Additional Medicare Tax with respect to wages disbursed by the common paymaster is computed as if there was a single employer, just as it is for application of the social security wage base. See section 7 of Publication 15-A for more information on common paymasters.\nIf an agent pays wages to an employee on behalf of an employer (under an approved Form 2678, Employer Appointment of Agent), then, for purposes of determining whether wages are paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold, should the agent combine those wages with wages paid to that same employee: 1) directly by the employer, 2) by the same agent on behalf of a different employer, or 3) by another agent on behalf of the same employer? \nIf an agent pays wages to an employee on behalf of an employer (under an approved Form 2678, Employer Appointment of Agent), then, for purposes of determining whether wages are paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold, should the agent combine those wages with wages paid to that same employee: 1) directly by the employer, 2) by the same agent on behalf of a different employer, or 3) by another agent on behalf of the same employer? \nIf an agent pays wages to an employee on behalf of an employer (under an approved Form 2678, Employer Appointment of Agent), then, for purposes of determining whether wages are paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold, should the agent combine those wages with wages paid to that same employee: 1) directly by the employer, 2) by the same agent on behalf of a different employer, or 3) by another agent on behalf of the same employer? \nNo. Wages paid by an agent with an approved Form 2678 on behalf of an employer are not combined with wages paid to the same employee by any of the above other parties in determining whether to withhold Additional Medicare Tax.\nI use an employee leasing company. How should wages be determined for purposes of the $200,000 withholding threshold?\nI use an employee leasing company. How should wages be determined for purposes of the $200,000 withholding threshold?\nI use an employee leasing company. How should wages be determined for purposes of the $200,000 withholding threshold?\nAn employer is required to withhold Additional Medicare Tax on wages paid to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Generally, if you provide wages in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold to the employee leasing company to pay to an employee that performs services for you, Additional Medicare Tax should be withheld from the wages in excess of $200,000. Taxpayers should be aware that the employer is ultimately responsible for the deposit and payment of federal tax liabilities. Even though you forward tax payments to a third party to make the tax deposits, you may be responsible as the employer for the tax liability.\n\nReporting Additional Medicare Tax and Correcting Errors\nWhen an employer deposits Additional Medicare Tax through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), does it need to separate Additional Medicare Tax from regular Medicare tax?\nWhen an employer deposits Additional Medicare Tax through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), does it need to separate Additional Medicare Tax from regular Medicare tax?\nWhen an employer deposits Additional Medicare Tax through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), does it need to separate Additional Medicare Tax from regular Medicare tax?\nNo. When providing the deposit detail, regular Medicare tax and Additional Medicare Tax are entered as one combined amount.\nHow does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on Form 941, Form 941-PR or Form 941-SS?\nHow does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on Form 941, Form 941-PR or Form 941-SS?\nHow does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on Form 941, Form 941-PR or Form 941-SS?\nLine 5d has beenadded to Form 941, Form 941-PR and Form 941-SS.On this line, employers report any individuals wages paid during the quarter that is in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold for the year as well asthe withholding liability for Additional Medicare Tax on those wages.\nNOTE:Report only wages & tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding and Additional Medicare Tax on Line 5d.Report Medicare wages & tips and Medicare tax on Line 5c.\nHow does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on Form W-2? \nHow does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on Form W-2? \nHow does an employer report Additional Medicare Tax on Form W-2? \nThere is no change to the boxes on Form W-2. An employer will enter the total employee Medicare tax (including any Additional Medicare Tax) withheld on Medicare wages and tips in box 6 (Medicare tax withheld). A railroad employer will report Additional Medicare Tax in box 14.\nIf an employer underwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, fails to withhold the tax when it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in the same year the wages are paid but after its Form 941 is filed, how can the employer correct this error? \nIf an employer underwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, fails to withhold the tax when it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in the same year the wages are paid but after its Form 941 is filed, how can the employer correct this error? \nIf an employer underwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, fails to withhold the tax when it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in the same year the wages are paid but after its Form 941 is filed, how can the employer correct this error? \nAn employer is liable for Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld, whether or not it deducts the tax from wages it pays to the employee. If the employer fails to withhold the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax from wages it pays to an employee and discovers the error in the same year it pays the wages, the employer may correct the error by making an interest-free adjustment on the appropriate corrected return (for example, Form 941-X). Once the employer has discovered the error, the employer should deduct the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax from other wages or other remuneration, if any, it pays to the employee on or before the last day of the calendar year. However, even if the employer is not able to deduct the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax from other wages or other remuneration it pays to the employee, the employer must report and pay the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax on its return. If the employer pays Additional Medicare Tax without having deducted it from wages or other remuneration it pays to the employee, the obligation of the employee to the employer with respect to the payment is a matter for settlement between the employer and the employee. For more information on adjustments, see section 13 of Pub 15 or visit the IRS website and enter the keywords: Correcting Employment Taxes.\nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in the same year the wages are paid, how can the employer correct this error? \nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in the same year the wages are paid, how can the employer correct this error? \nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in the same year the wages are paid, how can the employer correct this error? \nThe employer may correct the error by making an interest-free adjustment on the appropriate corrected return (for example, Form 941-X). The employer must first repay or reimburse the overwithheld amount to the employee prior to the end of the calendar year in which it paid the wages. If the employer does not repay or reimburse the employee the amount of overcollected Additional Medicare Tax before the end of the year in which the wages were paid, the employer can not correct the error via an interest-free adjustment. In this case, the employer should report the amount of withheld Additional Medicare Tax on the employees Form W-2 so that the employee may obtain credit for Additional Medicare Tax withheld on the employees individual income tax return. For more information on adjustments, see section 13 of Pub 15 or visit the IRS website and enter the keywords: Correcting Employment Taxes.\nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) from an employees wages, should the employer file a claim for refund for the Additional Medicare Tax? \nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) from an employees wages, should the employer file a claim for refund for the Additional Medicare Tax? \nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) from an employees wages, should the employer file a claim for refund for the Additional Medicare Tax? \nNo.An employer can only claim a refund of overpaid Additional Medicare Tax if it did not deduct or withhold the overpaid Additional Medicare Tax from the employees wages. For more information on claims for refund, see section 13 of Pub 15 or visit the IRS website and enter the keywords: Correcting Employment Taxes.\nIf an employer underwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, fails to withhold the tax when it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in a subsequent year, should the employer correct this error by making an interest-free adjustment?\nIf an employer underwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, fails to withhold the tax when it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in a subsequent year, should the employer correct this error by making an interest-free adjustment?\nIf an employer underwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, fails to withhold the tax when it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in a subsequent year, should the employer correct this error by making an interest-free adjustment?\nNo. If an employer underwithholds Additional Medicare Tax and does not discover the error in the same year wages were paid, the employer can not correct the error by making an interest-free adjustment. In this case, the employer should have reported the amount of Additional Medicare Tax withheld, if any, on the employees Form W-2 for the prior year. Additional Medicare Tax withholding will be applied against the taxes shown on the employees individual income tax return (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). The employee will report and pay all Additional Medicare Tax liability, including any liability that exceeds Additional Medicare Tax withheld, on the employees individual income tax return. To the extent the employer can show that the employee paid Additional Medicare Tax, the underwithheld amount will not be collected from the employer. The employer will remain subject to any applicable penalties.\nWhile the employer cannot correct the tax by making an interest-free adjustment, the employer corrects the amount of wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding on the appropriate X form (Form 941-X, Form 943-X, Form 944-X, or Form CT-1 X).\nForm 941-X\nForm 943-X\nForm 944-X\nForm CT-1 X\nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in a subsequent year, should the employer correct this error by making an interest-free adjustment?\nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in a subsequent year, should the employer correct this error by making an interest-free adjustment?\nIf an employer overwithholds Additional Medicare Tax (for example, withholds the tax before it pays the employee wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year) and discovers the error in a subsequent year, should the employer correct this error by making an interest-free adjustment?\nNo. If an employer withholds more than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax from wages paid to an employee and does not discover the error in the same year the wages were paid, the employer can not correct the error by making an interest-free adjustment. In this case, the employer should have reported the amount of Additional Medicare Tax withheld (including the overwithheld amount) on the employees Form W-2 for the prior year so that the employee may obtain credit for Additional Medicare Tax withheld. Additional Medicare Tax withholding will be applied against the taxes shown on the employees individual income tax return (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\nWhile the employer can not correct the tax by making an interest-free adjustment, the employer corrects the amount of wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding on the appropriate X form (Form 941-X, Form 943-X, Form 944-X, or Form CT-1 X).\nForm 941-X\nForm 943-X\nForm 944-X\nForm CT-1 X\n\nWage Repayments\nHow should employers treat repayment by an employee of wage payments received by the employee in a prior year for Additional Medicare Tax purposes (for example, sign on bonuses paid to employees that are subject to repayment if certain conditions are not satisfied)?\nHow should employers treat repayment by an employee of wage payments received by the employee in a prior year for Additional Medicare Tax purposes (for example, sign on bonuses paid to employees that are subject to repayment if certain conditions are not satisfied)?\nHow should employers treat repayment by an employee of wage payments received by the employee in a prior year for Additional Medicare Tax purposes (for example, sign on bonuses paid to employees that are subject to repayment if certain conditions are not satisfied)?\nEmployers cannot make an adjustment or file a claim for refund for Additional Medicare Tax withholding when there is a repayment of wages received by an employee in a prior year because the employee determines liability for Additional Medicare Tax on the employees income tax return for the prior year. In the case of a repayment of wages received by the employee in a year for which the employee has filed Form 1040 or 1040-SR, the employee should make a claim for refund for the Additional Medicare Tax paid using Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.
