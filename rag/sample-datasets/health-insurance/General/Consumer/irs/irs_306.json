On July 24, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulationsPDF (26 CFR Parts 51 and 602) on the fee. The final regulations describe the rules related to the fee, including how the IRS computes it and how covered entities pay it. The fee applies to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2010. On July 24, 2017, the IRS issued finalregulations thatdefine the term controlled group for purposes of the branded prescription drug fee.\nfinal regulations\nPDF\nfinal\nIn general, the fee is imposed on each covered entity with aggregated branded prescription drug sales of over $5 million to specified government programs or pursuant to coverage under such programs.\nTerms Defined\nBranded prescription drug (BPD) means (1) any prescription drug the application for which was submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)); or (ii) any biological product the license for which was submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).\nCovered entity means any manufacturer or importer with gross receipts from BPD sales, including a single-person covered entity or a controlled group.\nSpecified government programs (Programs) are the Medicare Part B program, the Medicare Part D program, the Medicaid program, any program under which BPDs are procured by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), any program under which BPDs are procured by the Department of Defense (DOD), and the TRICARE retail pharmacy program.\nReporting\nSales data for the fee is generally provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Programs of the Department of Health and Human Services (CMS), VA and DOD (Agencies). In addition, each covered entity may provide information relevant to the determination of the fee by annually submitting Form 8947, Report of Branded Prescription Drug InformationPDF. Submission of Form 8947 is voluntary.\nForm 8947, Report of Branded Prescription Drug Information\nPDF\nGenerally, covered entities may report the National Drug Code (NDC) of each BPD that the covered entity sold to the Programs (or pursuant to coverage under those Programs), Medicaid state rebate information, section 45C orphan drug information, members of controlled groups, and designated entity information on Form 8947.\nFor each fee year, a covered entity that chooses to submit Form 8947 reporting information for the sales year must file the form by November 1 of the preceding year. For example, for the 2015 fee year, a covered entity must submit its Form 8947 reporting information for the 2013 sales year by Monday, November 3, 2014 (after applying  7503).\nRelated Terms Defined\nControlled group means a group of two or more persons, including at least one person that is a covered entity, that is treated as a single employer under section 52(a), 52(b), 414(m), or 414(o).\nDesignated entity means the person that acts for a controlled group regarding the fee by (i) filing Form 8947; (ii) receiving IRS communications about the fee for the group; (iii) filing an error report for the group, if applicable; and (iv) paying the fee to the IRS.\nOrphan drug means any branded prescription drug for which any person claimed a credit under Internal Revenue Code section 45C and that credit was allowed for any taxable year, but does not include (i) any drug for which there has been a final assessment or court order disallowing the full section 45C credit taken for the drug; or (ii) any drug for any sales year after the calendar year in which the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for marketing for any indication other than the treatment of a rare disease or condition for which a section 45C credit was allowed, regardless of whether a section 45C credit was allowed for the drug either before, in the same year as, or after this FDA designation.\nFor a complete list of terms and definitions, please see 26 CFR 51.2.\n26 CFR 51.2\nFee Calculation\nThe fee for each covered entity is calculated by determining the ratio of (i) the covered entitys BPD sales taken into account during the sales year to (ii) the aggregate BPD sales taken into account for all covered entities during the same year, and applying this ratio to the applicable amount.\nRelated Terms Defined\nApplicable amount means the aggregate fee amount each year for all covered entities under section 9008(b)(4). The applicable amounts for fee years are:\nFee Year\nApplicable Amount\n2011\n$2.5 billion\n2012\n$2.8 billion\n2013\n$2.8 billion\n2014\n$3 billion\n2015\n$3 billion\n2016\n$3 billion\n2017\n$4 billion\n2018\n$4.1 billion\n2019 and thereafter\n$2.8 billion\nFee year means the calendar year in which the fee for a particular sales year must be paid to the government. For example, for the fee year of 2014, the sales year is 2012.\nSales taken into account means BPD sales after the application of the percentage adjustment table in section 9008(b)(2) (relating to annual sales less than $400,000,001), as shown below under Preliminary Fee.\nSales year means the second calendar year preceding the fee year.\nAllocation of Applicable Amount\nEvery fee year, the IRS will compute the fee for each covered entity based on the BPD sales data for each NDC reported by the Agencies, the exclusion of qualifying orphan drugs sales, and any rebate data for each NDC reported by the covered entity. Each NDC will be attributed to the covered entity that owns the NDC as of the end of the day on December 31st of the sales year.\nBPD sales for a covered entity for each Program equal:\nIn general, the fraction used to allocate the applicable amount among the covered entities is determined as follows:\nStep 1: Numerator  Covered Entity Sales Taken into Account\nFor each sales year and for each covered entity, the IRS will calculate BPD sales taken into account by: (1) adding the covered entitys BPD sales for each Program and (2) multiplying this amount by the appropriate percentage from the chart below:\nEach covered entities branded prescription drug sales for the calendar year that are:\nPercentage of branded drugs sales taken into account is:\n0\n10%\n40%\n75%\n100%\nThe resulting product is the sales taken into account for a covered entity. It is also the numerator of the fraction to be applied to the applicable amount to determine a covered entitys fee liability.\nFor example, if Covered Entity A had total BPD sales from all Programs of $150 million, its BPD sales taken into account would be:\n$5 million x 0 =  $0\n$120 million x 10% =  $12 million\n$25 million x 40% =  $10 million\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal$22 million\nStep 2: Denominator  Aggregate Sales Taken into Account\nFor each sales year, the IRS will total all BPD sales taken into account for each covered entity calculated under Step 1. This amount is the denominator of the fraction to be applied to the applicable amount.\nThe resulting fraction is multiplied by the applicable amount to determine each covered entitys fee.\nFor example, if Covered Entity A has $22 million in BPD sales taken into account (Step 1 calculation) and the aggregate amount of BPD sales taken into account for all covered entities (Step 2 calculation) is $440 million, then the fraction is $22 million/$440 million or 0.05. This fraction is then multiplied by the applicable amount for the year to determine Covered Entity As fee liability.\nAdjustment Amount\nFor each fee year after 2011, in addition to a covered entitys fee, the IRS will also calculate an adjustment amount that is the difference between the allocated fee determined for the covered entity in the immediately preceding fee year, using data from the second calendar year preceding that fee year, and what the allocated fee would have been for that entity for the immediately preceding fee year, using data from the calendar year immediately preceding that fee year.\nFor example, for 2014, the adjustment amount for a covered entity will be the difference between the entitys 2013 allocated fee using 2011 data and what the 2013 allocated fee would have been using 2012 data.\nAlthough the adjustment reflects a revision of the prior years fee based on data from the year immediately preceding the prior fee year, the adjustment is only taken into account by adding it to or subtracting it from the fee for the fee year to arrive at the final fee for the fee year.\nPreliminary Fee Notice  Letter 4657\nFor each sales year, the IRS will make a preliminary calculation of the fee for each covered entity. The IRS will notify each covered entity of this preliminary fee calculation by Letter 4657 that includes:\nThe IRS will mail each covered entity a paper notice of its preliminary fee calculation by March 1 of each fee year. Notice 2014-42PDF provides guidance on the branded prescription drug fee for each fee year.\nNotice 2014-42\nPDF\nDispute Process\nEach covered entity will have an opportunity to dispute the preliminary fee calculation by submitting an error report to the IRS. The IRS will provide its final determination with respect to error reports no later than the time the IRS provides a covered entity with a final fee calculation.\nA covered entity can submit two types of error reports:\nThe IRS forwards disputes of program drug sales to the appropriate Agencies for review and determination. CMS has a dedicated website to assist with Medicaid-related drug sales errors. Covered entities with Medicaid-related drug sales errors may review the information on the CMS website. All errors other than program drug sales errors are subject to review and determination by the IRS.\nCMS website\nFor a completion discussion on the dispute process, refer to 26 CFR 51.7.\n26 CFR 51.7\nEach covered entity must submit its error report(s) in the form and manner that is prescribed in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. (see Notice 2014-42PDF) This guidance will also prescribe the date by which each covered entity must submit its report(s).\nNotice 2014-42\nPDF\nAny changes made pursuant to the dispute resolution process will be reflected in the final fee calculation.\nFinal Fee Notice - Letter 4658\nNo later than August 31st of each fee year, the IRS will send each covered entity its final fee calculation for that year. In any fee year, the IRS will base its final fee calculation on data provided to it by the Agencies as adjusted pursuant to the dispute resolution process. The notification to a covered entity of its final fee calculation is by Letter 4658 and includes the following:\nA covered entitys final fee calculation may differ from the covered entitys preliminary fee calculation because of changes made pursuant to the dispute resolution process. A change made pursuant to the dispute resolution process can affect each covered entitys fee because each covered entitys fee is a fraction of the aggregate fee collected from all covered entities.\nEach covered entity must pay its final fee by September 30th of the fee year. The fee must be paid by electronic funds transfer as required by the regulations at 26 CFR 51.6302-1.\nFor a controlled group, the payment must be made using the designated entitys EIN as reported on Form 8947. In the case of a controlled group that is liable for the fee, all covered entities within a controlled group are jointly and severally liable for the fee.\nThere is no tax return to be filed for the fee.\nBPD Contact Information: IT BPD FEE\nIT BPD FEE\n"}
