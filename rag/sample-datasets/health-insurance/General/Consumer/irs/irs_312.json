Generally, small employers must provide employees with a qualified health plan from a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace to qualify for the credit.Also, small employers may only claim the credit for two consecutive years.\nSmall Business Health Care Tax Credit\nIn general, the relief provided today helps employers who first claim the credit for all or part of 2016 or a later taxable year for coverage offered through a SHOP Marketplace, but dont have SHOP Marketplace plans available to offer to employees for all or part of the remainder of the credit period because the county where the employer is located has no SHOP Marketplace plans.\nThe relief allows these employers to claim the credit for health insurance coverage provided outside of a SHOP Marketplace for the remainder of the credit period if that coverage would have qualified under the rules that applied before Jan. 1, 2014.\nNotice 2018-27PDF gives guidance about calculating the credit under these circumstances. The notice does not affect previous transition relief for the credit that was separately provided for 2014, 2015, and 2016.\nNotice 2018-27\nPDF\nFor information on whether a county had or has coverage available through a SHOP Marketplace, see the Who Gets the Credit section of the Questions and Answers about the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit on IRS.gov.\nQuestions and Answers about the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit\n"}
