An employer determines its number of full-time-equivalent employees for a month in the two steps that follow:\nAn employers number of full-time equivalent employees (or part-time employees) is only relevant to determining whether an employer is an ALE. An ALE need not offer minimum essential coverage to its part-time employees to avoid an employer shared responsibility payment. A part-time employees receipt of the premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Marketplace cannot trigger an employer shared responsibility payment.\nThe Employer Shared Responsibility Provision Estimator helps employers understand how the provision works and learn how the provision may apply to them. Employers can use the estimator to determine:\nEmployer Shared Responsibility Provision Estimator\nBasic ALE Determination Examples\nExample 1  Employer is Not an ALE\nExample 2  Employer is an ALE\nAdditional examples can be found in section 54-4980H-2 of the ESRP regulations.\nESRP regulations\nEmployer Aggregation Rules\nCompanies with a common owner or that are otherwise related under certain rules of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code are generally combined and treated as a single employer for determining ALE status. If the combined number of full-time employees and full-time equivalent employees for the group is large enough to meet the definition of an ALE, then each employer in the group (called an ALE member) is part of an ALE and is subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions, even if separately the employer would not be an ALE.\ndefinition of an ALE\nExample 3  Employers are Aggregated to Determine ALE Status:\nThere is an important distinction for employers to keep in mind regarding these aggregation rules. Although employers with a common owner or that are otherwise related generally are combined and treated as a single employer for determining whether an employer is an ALE, potential liability under the employer shared responsibility provisions is determined separately for each ALE member.\nAlso, a special standard applies to government entity employers in the application of the aggregation rules under section 414. Because section 414 relates to common ownership and ownership isnt a typical arrangement for government entities, and because specific rules under section 414 of the Code for government entities havent yet been developed, government entities may apply a good faith reasonable interpretation of section 414 to determine if they should be aggregated with any other government entities.\nSee Q&A #s11 and 44 on our employer shared responsibility provisions questions and answers page for more information.\nemployer shared responsibility provisions questions and answers page\n f\nSeasonal Workers\nWhen determining if an employer is an ALE, the employer must measure its workforce by counting all its employees. However, there is an exception for seasonal workers.\nexception for seasonal workers\nAn employer is not considered to have more than 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) if both of the following apply:\nA seasonal worker is generally defined for this purpose as an employee who performs labor or services on a seasonal basis. For example, retail workers employed exclusively during holiday seasons are seasonal workers. For more information about how seasonal workers affect ALE determinations, see our Questions and Answers page. For information on the difference between a seasonal worker and a seasonal employee under the employer shared responsibility provisions see Q&A #26. And for the full definition of seasonal worker, see section 54.4980H-1(a)(39) of the ESRP regulations.\nQuestions and Answers page\nESRP regulations\nApplication to New Employers\nA new employer (that is, an employer that was not in existence on any business day in the prior calendar year) is an ALE for the current calendar year if it reasonably expects to employ, and actually does employ, an average of at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) on business days during the current calendar year.
