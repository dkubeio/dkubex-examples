These include a step-by-step guide for determining eligibility, examples of typical tax savings under various scenarios, answers to frequently-asked questions, a YouTube video and a webinar.\nSmall Business Health Care Tax Credit\nThe small business health care tax credit was included in the Affordable Care Act enacted two years ago. Small employers that pay at least half of the premiums for employee health insurance coverage under a qualifying arrangement may be eligible for this credit. The credit is specifically targeted to help small businesses and tax-exempt organizations provide health insurance for their employees.\nDepending upon how they are structured, eligible small employers are likely subject to one of the following three tax-filing deadlines, which fall in coming weeks:\nForm 8941\nForm 3800\nForm 1040\nPDF\nForm 990-T\nPDF\nTaxpayers needing more time to determine eligibility should consider obtaining an automatic tax-filing extension, usually for six months. See Form 4868 for individuals, Form 7004 and its instructionsPDF for businesses and Form 8868 for tax-exempt organizations.\nForm 4868\nForm 7004\ninstructions\nPDF\nForm 8868\nBusinesses that have already filed and later find that they qualified in 2010 or 2011 can still claim the credit by filing an amended return for one or both years. Corporations use Form 1120XPDF, individuals use Form 1040XPDF and tax-exempt organizations use Form 990-T.\nForm 1120X\nPDF\nForm 1040X\nPDF\nSome businesses and tax-exempt organizations that already locked into health insurance plan structures and contributions may not have had the opportunity to make any needed adjustments to qualify for the credit for 2010 or 2011. These employers can still make the necessary changes to their health insurance plans so they qualify to claim the credit on 2012 returns or in years beyond.\nEligible small employers can claim the credit for 2010 through 2013 and for two additional years beginning in 2014.\nAdditional information about eligibility requirements and figuring the credit can be found on IRS.gov.\nFollow the IRS on New MediaSubscribe to IRS Newswire\nFollow the IRS on New Media\nSubscribe to IRS Newswire\n"}
