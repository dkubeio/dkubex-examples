The smaller the employer, the bigger the credit. So if you have more than 10 full-time equivalent employees or if the average wage is more than $25,000 (as adjusted for inflation), the amount of the credit you receive will be less. For example, if you pay $50,000 a year toward employees health care premiums,and if you qualify for a $10,000 credit each year, you can save $20,000 over the course of two years\nEven if your small business does not owe tax during the year, you can carry the credit back or forward to other tax years. Also, since the amount of the health insurance premium payments is more than the total credit, eligible small businesses can still claim a business expense deduction for the premiums in excess of the credit. Thats both a credit and a deduction for employee premium payments.\nEven if you are a small business employer who did not owe tax during the year, you can carry the credit back or forward to other tax years. Also, since the amount of the health insurance premium payments is more than the total credit, eligible small businesses can still claim a business expense deduction for the premiums in excess of the credit. Thats both a credit and a deduction for employee premium payments.\nThe credit is refundable, so if youre tax-exempt and have no taxable income, you may be eligible to receive the credit as a refund so long as it does not exceed your income tax withholding and Medicare tax liability. Refund payments issued to small tax-exempt employers claiming the refundable portion of the credit are subject to sequestration.\nsequestration\nYou can benefit from the credit this year or in previous years. If you didnt claim it on your tax return, theres still time to file an amended return. Refund limitations may apply. Generally, a claim for refund must be filed within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed by the taxpayer, within two years from the time the tax was paid.\nFor information about State-based SHOPs participating in the direct enrollment process, such as the one adopted by federally-facilitated SHOP Marketplaces, see the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) FAQsPDF about flexibilities for State-based SHOP direct enrollment.

You also wont include the premiums paid on behalf these employees to determine the amount of your health care tax credit:\nFor purposes of the health care tax credit, one FTE generally equals 2,080 hours per year. This is different from other provisions of the Affordable Care Act that count 30 hours per week as one FTE. Any number of part-time employees that work a combined number of hours equal to that of a full-time employee equals one FTE. For example, two half-time employees count as one FTE; 20 half-time employees is equivalent to 10 FTEs. Exclude from the calculation the hours that exceed 2,080. Also exclude seasonal employees who work 120 or fewer days per year from the calculation of the number of FTEs and average annual wages; however, the health insurance premiums paid by the employer on behalf of these employees may be counted in determining the amount of the credit.\nCalculating average annual wages\nIf you pay total annual wages of $200,000 to your 10 FTEs, you divide $200,000 by 10  the number of FTEs  to determine your average annual wage. In this example, the average annual wage would be $20,000.\nClaiming the health care tax credit\nYou must use Form 8941, Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums, to calculate the credit.
