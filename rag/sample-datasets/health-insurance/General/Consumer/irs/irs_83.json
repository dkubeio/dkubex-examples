L. 116-94), signed into law on December 20, 2019, has repealed the medical device excise tax previously imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. Prior to the repeal, the tax was on a 4-year moratorium. As a result of the repeal and the prior moratorium, sales of taxable medical devices after December 31, 2015, are not subject to the tax.\nFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub. L. 116-94)\nSection 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer or importer of the device.\nOn Dec. 5, 2012, the IRS and the Department of the Treasury issued final regulations on the new 2.3-percent medical device excise tax (IRC 4191) that manufacturers and importers began to pay on their sales of certain medical devices starting in 2013. On Dec. 5, 2012, the IRS and the Department of the Treasury also issued Notice 2012-77, which provides interim guidance on certain issues related to the medical device excise tax.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law on Dec. 18, 2015, included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. The medical device excise tax did not apply to the sale of a taxable medical device by the manufacturer, producer or importer of the device during the period beginning on Jan. 1, 2016, and ending on Dec. 31, 2017.\nH.R. 195 (Pub. L. 115-120), signed into law on Jan. 22, 2018, extends for an additional two years the moratorium on the medical device excise tax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. Because of the moratorium, the medical device excise tax does not apply to the sale of taxable medical devices by the manufacturer, producer or importer of the device during the period beginning on Jan. 1, 2016, and ending on Dec. 31, 2019. Further, because the extension of the moratorium is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2018, manufacturers, producers and importers of taxable medical devices should not make deposits of tax or report any medical device excise tax liability on Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, for sales of taxable medical devices between Jan. 1, 2018, and Jan. 22, 2018.\nAdditional information is available on the Medical Device Excise Tax page on IRS.gov.\nMedical Device Excise Tax\nBasic Information\nReporting\nExemptions and Exceptions\nMoratorium Information\nBasic Information\nBasic Information\nBasic Information\n1.
