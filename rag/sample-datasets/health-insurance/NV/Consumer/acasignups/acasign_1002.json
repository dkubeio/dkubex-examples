Consumers can also explore 20 qualified dental plans among six dental carriers. Nevada Health Link also partners with VSP to offer vision plans. Qualified health plans are available in all counties across the state. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan Act, passed by Congress and signed by President Biden on March 11, 2021, there is an increase in tax credits available to help lower the costs of monthly premiums.\nThe passing of the American Rescue Plan Act allows Nevadans to continue to receive increased subsidies when they enroll in health insurance plans through Nevada Health Link, said Silver State Health Insurance Exchanges Executive Director Heather Korbulic. Additionally, NevadaHealthLink.com is the only place consumers can access federal financial assistance (subsidies) to help offset the costs of insurance. In fact, 90 percent of applicants who purchase a plan through the Exchange are eligible for financial assistance.\nWHO: Health plans offered through NevadaHealthLink.com are ideal for Nevadans who do not have employer-sponsored health insurance, including the self-employed and gig workers; those who are not receiving or do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid; new Nevada residents; or anyone seeking comprehensive, affordable health care coverage.\nEvery eligible Nevadan, including healthy Nevadans, should be covered by health insurance, to protect their health and to avoid financial ruin in case of an emergency health situation, said Governor Steve Sisolak. The Open Enrollment Period is the best time, and one of the only times, for Nevadans to explore and shop plans through Nevada Health Link. Even Nevadans who are already insured with a plan through Nevada Health Link should consider looking at the new plan options.
