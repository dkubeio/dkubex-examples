Unfortunately, they've only published enrollment data through December 2020. In some states I've been able to get more recent enrollment data from state websites and other sources.\nToday I'm presenting Nevada.\nFor enrollment data from January 2021 on, I'm relying on adjusted estimates based on raw data from the Nevada Dept. of Health & Human Services.\nNevada's total Medicaid enrollment (including ACA expansion) held steady at around 600,000 residents throughout 2016 - 2019...but once the COVID pandemic struck, it took off sharply, with traditional enrollment increasing by over 18% and ACA expansion jumping nearly 40%. Overall enrollment is up by around 26% since last February.\nNevada has 3,104,614 residents according to the 2020 U.S. Census. As of April 2021:\n \n"}
