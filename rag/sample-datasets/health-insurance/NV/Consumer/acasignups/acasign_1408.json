(April 16, 2021)  Nevada Health Link, the online health insurance marketplace operated by the state agency, the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange), is offering even bigger coverage savings to eligible uninsured and insured off-Exchange Nevadans. These new enhancements are in accordance with the newly-enacted American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA or American Rescue Plan) of 2021 passed by Congress and signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021.\nStarting next week on April 20, 2021, Nevada Health Link is planning for full implementation of ARPA subsidy and Unemployment Insurance rules. Changes made after the ARPA implementation will take effect the first of the following month. Nevada Health Link is the only place Nevadans can shop and compare over 50 quality, comprehensive health plans to access increased and expanded financial assistance to lower monthly insurance premiums through ARPA. In addition, ARPA increases the opportunity for an unprecedented number of Nevadans to receive subsidies for the first time, including Nevadans making over 400% of the federal poverty level.\nWith these important new policies in place, now is the time for Nevadans to take advantage of the wide range of affordable, high-quality health insurance options available through Nevada Health Link, said Heather Korbulic, Executive Director of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. Whether you are uninsured or looking for a new plan to meet your personal and financial needs, Nevada Health Link offers an easy path to finding the right health insurance.\nFor the first time, since the Affordable Care Act, there are bigger savings for individuals and families who may not have been eligible for savings prior to the passage of this legislation, said Janel Davis, Communications Officer for the Exchange. Nevadans who are facing the deep economic ramifications of the pandemic can breathe a sigh of relief knowing they may be eligible for increased or expanded subsidies.\nWhat does this mean for Nevadans?\nHow do Nevadans find out if they qualify for savings?\nOn April 20, 2021, Nevadans can provide income and household information to find out if and how much their monthly premiums will decrease. Customers will be eligible for the new benefits on the first of the following month, and they will start to see those benefits in their accounts when the updates required under the new law are made.\nTo learn more, follow these simple steps:\n"}
