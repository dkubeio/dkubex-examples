The ARPA, enacted earlier this month, creates more opportunities for Nevadans to save on health insurance coverage.\nI urge consumers, especially those who have off-exchange plans, have no insurance or have found themselves uninsured to start thinking now about how they can benefit from this new law because certain benefits in the ARPA have deadlines, said Insurance Commissioner Barbara Richardson. Each month that a consumer does not take advantage of these new low or no cost opportunities, they are leaving money on the table.\nThe ARPA will lower monthly premium costs; increase subsidy eligibility for consumers making above the 400% of the Federal Poverty Level; provide options for people who are on unemployment for $0 premium plans; and it will provide 100% COBRA subsidy for six months.\nStarting April 1 until September 30, 2021, consumers have the option to obtain COBRA insurance at no premium cost for six months. Prior to the ARPA, COBRA insurance was available for employees who lost their employer-sponsored coverage because of an involuntary termination or reduction in hours to remain in that health coverage under the condition the former employee pay the full premium cost for the coverage plus an administrative fee, resulting in expensive premiums. Consumers need to contact their employer or former employer for COBRA coverage.\nThe Division is working alongside Nevadas Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange), which is the state agency that connects Nevadans to qualified health plans through the online State Based Exchange (SBE) known as Nevada Health Link, to implement these changes and provide relevant information to consumers.\nAll Nevadans, no matter their circumstances  uninsured, underinsured, insured with on or off- exchange plans, Nevadans who lost their job, who were not eligible for financial subsidies before  may benefit from these changes explained Commissioner Richardson.\nMore information regarding COBRA and other aspects of the ARPA can be found on the Divisions websiteand on Nevada Health Links website.\n"}
