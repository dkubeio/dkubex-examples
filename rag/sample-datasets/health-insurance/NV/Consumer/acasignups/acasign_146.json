As the redetermination process associated with the unwinding of the Public Health Emergency continues, Nevada Health Link, Nevadas health insurance marketplace, is continuing to work diligently to streamline the enrollment process for individuals and households whose increased income no longer qualifies them for Medicaid coverage.\nNevada Health Link has implemented numerous enhancements to its marketplace portal, Enroll.NevadaHealthLink.com, and has conducted extensive outreach to thousands of individuals whose information was transferred to them by the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS), Nevadas Medicaid administrator. This effort, which has included over 6,500 outbound calls to Nevadans who have been notified that they are no longer eligible for Medicaid benefits, is intended to provide assistance with next steps for getting enrolled in an affordable, qualified health insurance plan.\nIn July, Nevada Health Link saw a 50% increase in the number of individuals who submitted a marketplace enrollment after losing their existing Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage. However, impacted Nevadans who have not yet enrolled through the marketplace still have time to obtain comprehensive coverage without compromising their financial stability. Nevada Health Link is the only place Nevadans can receive subsidized plans to help reduce the costs of monthly premiums, some even as low as $0 per month. Over 80% of all enrollees also qualify for financial assistance and subsidies.\nNevada Health Link remains steadfast in its commitment to simplifying the enrollment journey on NevadaHealthLink.com and being a direct and proactive resource to those who no longer qualify for coverage through Medicaid, said Katie Charleson, Communications Officer of Nevada Health Link. If any individuals have been told they no longer qualify for Medicaid benefits due to over-income, we highly encourage those folks to take a few minutes to reach out to our team and learn more about your options to get coverage and receive financial assistance through Nevada Health Link.\nFor those who receive a DWSS redetermination packet in the mail regarding their Medicaid eligibility status, timely completion and submission is essential to ensure an accurate redetermination. Individuals or households who are confident that their income is over the Medicaid eligibility threshold must still complete and return their packet in order to receive a referral to Nevada Health Link.\nWith a robust set of Qualified Health Plan options to choose from, all plans offered on NevadaHealthLink.com are required to offer the 10 Essential Health Benefits, which include coverage of ambulatory, emergency, hospitalization, maternity, mental health, prescription drugs, rehab, lab services, preventative visits, and pediatric care.\nNevadans who are deemed ineligible for Medicaid benefits qualify for a special enrollment period from the day they are notified of their coverage loss to enroll in a plan through Nevada Health Link. Nevada Health Link encourages Medicaid recipients to update their contact information in their Medicaid account and continue checking for notices regarding their renewal/expiration date.
