Since the passage of the ACA and the implementation of Nevada Health Link, the Exchanges online marketplace for ACA-compliant insurance plans, Nevada's number of uninsured has decreased from a staggering 23 percent to 11 percent.\nToday, the recent passing of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) on March 11, 2021 is just one demonstration of President Bidens commitment to the health of Americans. Thanks to the ARPA, Americans will benefit from expanded subsidies, lower premiums and access to applying for health insurance outside of the traditional Open Enrollment windows.\nThe Exchange could not be where it is today if not for the visionary leadership of former Gov. Brian Sandoval, current Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, and many other elected officials and community partners who joined forces with our team to connect uninsured individuals with health insurance, especially during this past very difficult and trying year.\nWhile its never a good idea to be without health insurance, the pandemic elevated the healthcare conversation, illuminating the need for health insurance and reminding us that illness does not discriminate.\nUnder the new administration, the health and future of the ACA shines bright. We remain laser-focused on our core mission: to reach uninsured Nevadans and help them safeguard themselves and their families with an ACA plan through Nevada Health Link.\nThe current Special Enrollment Period, which was made possible by an Executive Order from President Biden earlier this year, is happening now through May 15. Coupled with the ARPAs new enhancements, new and existing consumers will soon enjoy a full shopping experience, explore expanded subsidies, modify their health insurance plans and select a plan that best fits their needs.\nVisit NevadaHealthLink.com to find out more information on ACA-compliant health insurance plans and for the latest updates.\n"}
