Korbulic calls that number \"significant.\"\n\"We're really enthusiastic about getting into the weeds and doing some outreach to folks that are typically underinsured or potentially uninsured fora variety of different reasons. This gives us extra time to do that,\" she said.\n600 people (86/day) might not sound like much, but it's worth noting that Nevada has a fairly small population (3.14million). The closest state to it is Iowa (3.16 million) which enrolled 1,436 people in the first2weeks, or 103/day; without knowing whether enrollment ramped up or not in the second week it's hard to draw any conclusion here.\nIn any event, Nevadans who aren't already enrolled in an on-exchange ACA policy can do so up through May 15th...and with the pending final passage of the American Rescue Plan, they'll have a lot more incentive to do so!\n"}
