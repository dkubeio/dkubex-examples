On behalf of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange and Nevadans statewide, we are pleased to see positive change taking place at the federal level and to witness the fastmoving actions to protect the Affordable Care Act (ACA), upon which so many Americans rely for quality, affordable and comprehensive health insurance coverage.\nThis news comes on the heels of our announcement that nearly 82,000 Nevadans enrolled on Nevada Health Link for coverage in 2021. Thats nearly a six percent increase from last years enrollment total.\nTodays news from the White House speaks volumes about how the new Administration will continue to support the ACA and help to bolster the health insurance marketplace, protecting hundreds of millions of Americans.\nWe look forward to collaborating with our carriers, other state agencies, and our statewide network of brokers and navigators who are standing by to help Nevadans get connected with health insurance. We offer assistance in multiple languages, including Spanish, Tagalog and Mandarin.\nAnd as a reminder, the Exchange is the only place can qualify for subsidies to offset the cost of insurance premiums. Especially during the COVID19 pandemic, no Nevadan should be without health insurance. We are here to help.\nSomewhat vaguely worded. Some state-based ACA exchanges already announced COVID enrollment periods yesterday to coincide with the newly-announced one at the federal exchange (which runs from 2/15 - 5/15. Others (New York, Maryland, Massachusetts) had already announced extensions of their existing Open Enrollment Period before yesterday's HC.gov announcement; all three of those are already in place and run through March.\nNevada's press release is similar to MNsure's in Minnesota; they announced that yes, they're also re-launching a COVID enrollment period but haven't worked out the dates or other details yet.\nUPDATE 2/03/21: They still haven't put out a formal press release, but I've been assured by several folks in the know that Nevada will indeed be following the same time window as HealthCare.Gov (from 2/15 - 5/15).\nUPDATE 2/03/21:\nUPDATE x2: Annnnnd there it is:\nUPDATE x2:\nNevada Health Link opens Special Enrollment Period in response to Pres. Bidens Executive Order, relative to the ongoing COVID-19 national emergency\nCarson City, Nev.  The Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange), the state agency that connects Nevadans to qualified health plans compliant with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) through the online State Based Exchange (SBE) known as Nevada Health Link, announces a 90-day Special Enrollment Period (SEP) for uninsured Nevadans, starting February 15 through May 15, 2021. The SEP is in accordance with the Executive Order issued by President Biden last month, in response to the ongoing national emergency presented by COVID-19.\nThe Exchange is excited to announce our participation in the upcoming Special Enrollment Period, giving uninsured Nevadans another opportunity to purchase affordable health insurance, especially as we continue to face unprecedented challenges during the ongoing pandemic, said Heather Korbulic, executive director, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. The SEP begins exactly one month after the closure of our traditional Open Enrollment Period for 2021 health insurance coverage, in which we connected nearly 82,000 Nevadans to comprehensive and quality health coverage through Nevada Health Link. As soon as Nevada learned of the news from the federal government, we took immediate action to plan and collaborate with our vendor, other State Based Exchanges, on-exchange insurance carriers and the statewide network of 750-plus brokers and navigators to implement a seamless, streamlined process for Nevadans looking to get connected during this unique enrollment period. Pandemic or no pandemic, no Nevadan should ever be without health insurance.\nUninsured Nevadans will have 90 days  Feb. 15 through 11:59 p.m. on May 15  to submit an application for health insurance on Nevada Health Link. This SEP is available for any Nevadan who missed the Open Enrollment Period and is uninsured; please note existing enrollees will NOT have the opportunity to shop and change their current plan.\nThe Exchange is the only place Nevadans can qualify for subsidies to help offset the cost of insurance premiums. Four out of five Nevadans who purchase a plan through Nevada Health Link qualify for financial assistance (tax credits).\n"}
