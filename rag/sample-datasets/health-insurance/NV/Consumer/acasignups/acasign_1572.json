These enrollment figures exceed 2019s enrollment figures by 4,493  a 5.8 percent increase.\nEven during one of the most turbulent and difficult years, many Nevadans made the smart decision to safeguard themselves and their loved ones by purchasing comprehensive and quality health insurance through Nevada Health Link, said Heather Korbulic, executive director, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. Our priority has always been to reduce the number of uninsured and underinsured individuals, families and children in Nevada. We do this by connecting them with plans appropriate for their needs, budget and lifestyle and providing subsidies to qualifying individuals that help offset the costs of insurance. We are pleased to see so many people recognize the importance of being covered, especially with the unprecedented events that occurred in 2020 surrounding COVID-19. During a time when families are burdened with the stress brought on by the global pandemic, worrying about health insurance and the financial ruin associated with a medical event shouldnt be one of them. The ongoing health emergency has affected thousands across Nevada and the nation, but virus or no virus, it is always a good idea to have health insurance.\nThis past open enrollment (Nov. 1, 2020  Jan. 15, 2021) was the Exchanges second enrollment period since transitioning to a State Based Exchange (SBE), which allowed the Exchange to operate more autonomously, including the ability to extend open enrollment by 30 additional days. The final enrollment figure is also a huge success, given the political uncertainty of the ACA created by the recent presidential election as well as a recent Supreme Court hearing that challenged the ACA. With the inauguration of President Joe Biden this week, the Exchange looks forward to the support of the ACA from the new administration.\nThis past Open Enrollment, Nevada Health Link offered nearly double the number of plans from last year, including 50 qualified health plans from five carriers: Health Plan of Nevada (HPN), SilverSummit (Ambetter), Anthem HMO Co, Friday Health Plans and SelectHealth. Nevada Health Link also offered 27 dental plans from six dental carriers and two vision plans from VSP Vision Care.\nNevada Health Link is the only place consumers can qualify for subsidies to help make monthly premiums more affordable. Four out of five Nevadans who purchase a plan through Nevada Health Link qualify for financial assistance (tax credits). All plans offered through the Exchange cover the ten essential health benefits such as pre-existing conditions and all COVID-19-related diagnosis and treatment.\nExchange plans are ideal for those who dont qualify for Medicare or Medicaid but still need financial assistance; those who dont have employee-sponsored health insurance, including independent contractors and gig workers; and anyone seeking comprehensive, quality and affordable plans.\nWhile open enrollment has ended, it is important to remember that certain Qualifying Life Events (QLEs), such as losing health insurance, change of employment or income, getting married, having a child or moving, can make an individual eligible for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) that allows enrollment at any time during the year. An individual or household should report the life event within 60 days to get covered. To find out if youre eligible and to learn more, visit NVHealthLink.com or call 1-800-547-2927.\n"}
