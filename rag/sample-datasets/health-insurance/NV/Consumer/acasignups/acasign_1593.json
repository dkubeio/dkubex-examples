Coverage of our comprehensive plans also includes the 10 essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act, said Janel Davis, communications officer, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. There is no need to buy additional insurance for COVID coverage, despite what some are fraudulently promoting. The January 15th deadline for Open Enrollment is just around the corner, and we urge anyone who is uninsured or underinsured to contact Nevada Health Link today.\nThe Exchange has aligned with the Nevada Division of Insurance (DOI) and the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to update communities statewide about how, where and when a COVID-19 vaccine will be available. Last year, the DOI passed both emergency and permanent regulations to ensure there would be no out-of-pocket costs to insured Nevadans for COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccines. People who are insured and are charged for COVID- related services should report the case to the Nevada Insurance Commissioner and the case may be referred for investigation.\nNevada Health Link is the only place consumers can qualify for subsidies to help offset the cost of monthly premiums, and four out of five Nevadans who purchase a plan on Nevada Health Link qualify for financial assistance (tax credits). The ten essential health benefits also include hospitalization, prenatal and newborn care and lab services. Consumers who enroll on or before Jan. 15 will have coverage effective on Feb. 1, 2021.\nExchange plans are ideal for those who do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid but still need financial assistance; those who do not have employee-sponsored health insurance, including independent contractors and gig workers; and anyone seeking comprehensive, quality and affordable plans. Anyone who believes they may qualify for Nevada Medicaid benefits can apply here.\nFor more information, visit NevadaHealthLink.com or call 1-800-547-2927. Methods to enroll in health insurance include virtual and contactless assistance in various languages, including Spanish, Tagalog and Mandarin, via telephone and online, or in-person, for those who prefer it. The Call Center is open 9am to 5pm PST, seven days a week, through January 15. The call center will offer special extended hours and remain open until 11:59pm PST January 14 and 15.\n"}
