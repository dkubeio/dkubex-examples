While most of the country prepares to conclude their open enrollment periods s this week on Dec. 15, Nevadans have an additional 30 days to enroll in health insurance coverage for 2021. Now through Jan. 15, 2021, Nevada Health Link, the online health insurance marketplace operated by the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange), remains open and available for Nevadans to purchase comprehensive, Affordable Care Act (ACA) compliant health plans for 2021. As a State Based Exchange (SBE), Nevada Health Link makes its own decisions and is autonomous from the federal marketplace  HealthCare.gov  therefore allowing for an extended Open Enrollment Period (OEP), which is one of the many advantages to operating as a SBE.\nAs of Dec. 13, 71,539 Nevadans have enrolled in a health insurance plan for 2021. With more than 30 days remaining in Open Enrollment for 2021 coverage, that number is obviously expected to trend upward with a typical surge in enrollment closer to the deadline.\nNevada Health Link is the only place consumers can qualify for subsidies to help offset the costs of monthly premiums, and four out of five Nevadans who purchase a plan on Nevada Health Link qualify for financial assistance (tax credits).\nAll plans offered through the Exchange cover the ten essential health benefits including pre-existing conditions and all COVID-19-related diagnosis and treatment. Consumers should know they must enroll in a plan by Dec. 31, 2020 to have health coverage effective on Jan. 1, 2021. Anyone who enrolls between Jan. 1 and Jan. 15 will have coverage effective on Feb. 1, 2021.\nThere are many consumers across the country scrambling to enroll in health insurance before their states marketplaces close their open enrollment periods on Dec. 15, said Heather Korbulic, executive director, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. But Nevadans are in luck, because there is another month left before our Open Enrollment Period ends on January 15. And with the busy holiday season upon us, consumers still have plenty of time to explore, compare and purchase their health insurance plans. If 2020 has taught us anything, its that health is the new wealth. There is no greater gift than the peace of mind that comes with knowing you and your family are covered with a comprehensive plan that will allow you to access a better quality of care, while protecting you from financial ruin, should you experience a medical event. Health insurance is the ultimate holiday gift.\nExchange plans are ideal for those who dont qualify for Medicare or Medicaid but still need financial assistance; those who dont have employee-sponsored health insurance, including independent contractors and gig workers; and anyone seeking comprehensive, quality and affordable plans.\nThis year, Nevada Health Link has 50 qualified health plans to offer  nearly double the numbers of plans offered last year  from five carriers, including Health Plan of Nevada (HPN), SilverSummit (Ambetter), Anthem HMO Co, Friday Health Plans and SelectHealth. Nevada Health Link also offers 27 dental plans from six dental carriers and has recently partnered with VSP to offer vision plans.\nNevada Health Link is working with certified brokers and navigators to ensure there are plenty of opportunities and methods to enroll in health insurance, including virtual and contactless assistance in various languages, including Spanish, Tagalog and Mandarin, via telephone and online, or in-person, for those who prefer it.
