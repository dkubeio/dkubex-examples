The Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange), Nevadas state agency that helps individuals obtain budget-appropriate health coverage through the online marketplace, Nevada Health Link, has extended its Open Enrollment deadline to 11:59 p.m. PST Friday, Dec. 20 for consumers who started the application process on or before the Dec. 15 midnight Open Enrollment deadline.\n\"We recognize the enrollment process for health insurance can be time-consuming. Thats why we are giving consumers five extra days to complete their application to purchase plans for coverage that begins Jan. 1, 2020,\" said Heather Korbulic, executive director, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange.\n\"This flexibility is another example of the many advantages of operating as a State Based Exchange (SBE) rather than being reliant on the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov. We are confident giving five additional days to consumers who initiated the enrollment process prior to the Dec. 15 close of Open Enrollment deadline will help them secure a much needed health plan. The call center representatives are still working to provide technical assistance for consumers who may have questions in completing their online enrollment applications before the extended midnight Dec. 20 deadline.\nNevada Health Link's call center hours through Dec. 20 are: Monday through Thursday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m, and Friday, Dec. 20 from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.\nNevada Health Link offers Qualified Health and Dental Plans (QHPs) that cover the ten essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This includes covering pre-existing conditions, maternity and newborn care, mental health, preventive care and pediatric dental care. Nevadans who do not qualify for Medicaid, Medicare, or do not have insurance through their employer are eligible to enroll for insurance through Nevada Health Link. Nevada Health Link is the only place Nevadans can qualify for subsidies and tax credits that can offset the costs of insurance. According to a recent report from the Guinn Center, there are approximately 77,000 residents in Nevada who qualify for subsidies and tax credits that can help offset the monthly costs of insurance.\nThis year, Nevada Health Link offered 27 QHPs through three insurance carriers  Health Plan of Nevada and SilverSummit, which returned to the Exchange from the previous year, as well as Anthem HMO Co., which rejoined the Exchange for Plan Year 2020. All 27 health plans were available to Nevada residents in Clark, Nye, and Washoe counties. SilverSummit and Anthem HMO Co. offered 17 plans to residents in Nevadas 14 rural counties including Carson City, Churchill, Douglas, Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Lincoln, Lyon, Mineral, Pershing, Storey and White Pine. Six carriers offered 17 Qualified Dental Plans (QDPs) to Nevada residents statewide.\n"}
