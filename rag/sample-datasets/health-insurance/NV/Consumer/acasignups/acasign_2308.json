(KLAS) Nearly 60,500 Nevadans have enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan for plan year 2020 since open enrollment began on Nov. 1.\nThe Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, which runs online insurance marketplace Nevada Health Link, announced these numbers just 15 days into the enrollment period.\nNevada Health Link migrated 65,563 Nevadans from HealthCare.gov onto the State Based Exchange platform at NevadaHealthLink.com.\nAt exactly one-third of the way into open enrollment, we are enthusiastic about the level of engagement weve seen from consumers and brokers, said Heather Korbulic, executive director of Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, in a press release. While we still have work to do to reach the uninsured populations throughout our state, we remain optimistic that we will see enrollment numbers continue to rise throughout the duration of this enrollment period.\nThe agency says this is the first year Nevada Health Link will no longer rely on HealthCare.gov after the transition began in 2018.\nThere are 733 brokers, 64 certified enrollment counselors, eight navigator entities and 30 exchange enrollment facilitators on the agencys staff.

From the sounds of it, everything went pretty smoothly.\nNevada had a total of 83,449 people select Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) during the 2019 Open Enrollment Period. Via normal monthly attrition, however, this number had apparently gradually dropped off to around 80% of that as of early November; the 65.6K figure is the total number of Nevadans who were still enrolled in HC.gov policies (or at least who had open HC.gov accounts) who were migrated over to the new state-based exchange platform.\nOf those, it sounds like over 92% of them have already either selected a policy for 2020 or, in most cases, been automatically renewed/re-enrolled in a policy for 2020.\nUPDATE: Here's the official press release with additional details:\nUPDATE:\nNevada Health Link Announces Enrollment Numbers from the First 15 Days of Open Enrollment\nCarson City, NV - The Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, the state agency that runs the online insurance marketplace known as Nevada Health Link announces as of November 15that 15 days into the 45-day open enrollment period60,460 Nevadans have been enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan.
