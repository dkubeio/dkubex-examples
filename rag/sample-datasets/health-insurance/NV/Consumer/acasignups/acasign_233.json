It took less than 12 hours from this announcement by the COLORADO Dept. of Regulatory Agencies to be released...\nFriday Health Plans, Inc. Winding Down Business\nWhat Happened?\nFriday Health Plans, Inc., the parent company of Friday Health Plan of Colorado, ,Inc. (HMO), has announced that it will begin to wind down its business activities throughout the country, working in close conjunction with state regulators, including the Colorado Division of Insurance.\nIn recent months, it became apparent that the parent company would need to raise substantial capital to continue. Friday was ultimately unable to raise that capital and on June 1, Friday Health Plans, Inc. (Parent) stated publicly that they would begin to wind down.\n...tothispress release from theNEVADADivision of Insurance:\nJUNE 1, 2023 - Nevada Division of Insurance files court petition to place Friday Health Plans of Nevada in receivership\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Thursday, June 1, 2023\nNevada Division of Insurance files court petition to place Friday Health Plans of Nevada in receivership\nCARSON CITY, NV Nevada Insurance Commissioner, Scott Kipper, has filed legal action with the Nevada District Court to place Friday Health Plans of Nevada under regulatory supervision. This action will allow the Commissioner to assume oversight and management of the day-to-day operations of the company, while performing a thorough financial analysis.\nFriday Health Plans of Nevada is a Nevada-domiciled health insurance company and a subsidiary of Colorado-based Friday Health Plan Group.The company has been licensed to sell insurance in Nevada since May 2020 and currently has approximately 2,805 policyholders in Nevada.\nThe primary responsibility of the Division of Insurance is to protect the consumers of the state, said Insurance Commissioner Scott Kipper. Through this receivership, we can further evaluate the health of the company and determine how to best serve the interests of Nevadans.\nPolicyholders contracts will remain in effect and members will need to continue to pay their premiums in accordance with the terms of their policies to ensure there is no disruption to their coverage.Once the court places the company in receivership, the Commissioner, through an appointed special deputy receiver, will communicate with policyholders during the receivership process.\nInformation may also be accessed through the Nevada Division of Insurance website atdoi.nv.govor by calling the Division of Insurance at (888) 872-3234.\nThis press release doesn't say anything about whether or not the likely ~5,000 or so Friday enrollees in Nevada (remember, that's 2,805policyholders, which likely have more than one enrollee per policy) will have their policies remain effectuated all the way through the end of December. That wassupposedto be the case in Georgia, but just yesterday that assumption was proven wrong, so who knows?\nUPDATE: Annnnnnnd Oklahoma just threw Friday on the fire as well:\nUPDATE\nTwo more states are placing Friday Health Plans into receivership after the struggling insurtech company said Thursday it plans to shutter its business nationwide: Nevadas insurance commissioner asked a district court for approval to take over Fridays operations on June 1, a spokesperson confirmed. And Oklahomas Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready tellsInside Health Policythat Friday is in receivership as of today (June 2) -- and says hes exploring ways to ensure the 8,000 enrollees can get new coverage without sacrificing the money theyve spent toward deductibles.\n...Bloomberg analyst Duane Wright says Fridays demise appears to be part of a broader theme where start-ups try to break into the health insurance field but are unable to loosen the grip of the major players.We're seeing these challenges play out -- Bright Health is another -- even as the mainstays like UnitedHealth Group, Centene, and Elevance continue to grow. Health insurance isn't really a field that has an opening for disruptors. he says.\n...Mulready tellsIHPthat a special enrollment period is likely for Oklahoma too. But first hes talking with other plans in the state about potentially assuming the risk for Fridays enrollees and ensuring the money consumers spent toward their deductibles is not lost. Im trying to be creative, he says, noting the conversations are ongoing, and he adds that hes also in discussions with CMS.\n...Colorados exchange is not considering a special enrollment period at this time.\n"}
