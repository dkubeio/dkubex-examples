On the other hand, there's this, although I'm not sure what it actually means:\nAssembly Bill 170, which also sets up a procedure to help health care consumers navigate and resolve problems with insurers, was rewritten to incorporate safeguards that were originally the basis ofa different Senate bill that passed earlier.\nAnyway, this is still a Good Thing, although theredoesremain the issue of how individual states plan on makingACA-compliant policies affordable to lower- and moderate-income people without the accompanying premium & deductible subsidies which make up the Green Leg of the ACA's 3-Legged Stool.\n"}
