Nevada Health Link commemorates 13 years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law by President Barack Obama. The ACA is credited for the creation and ongoing operations of Nevada Health Link, Nevadas state agency that facilitates the sale of qualified health and dental plans. Since the inception of the ACA, Nevada Health Link has enrolled over 800,000 individuals to get connected to budget-appropriate health coverage through the online health insurance marketplace, NevadaHealthLink.com.\nSince its passing on March 23, 2010, the landmark health reform law has proven to be one of the most significant health care reform landmarks in the United States and has had a critical impact on providing more affordable and qualified health care to tens of thousands of Nevadans across the Silver State.\nSince becoming a fully operational State-Based Exchange (SBE) in Plan Year 2019, Nevada Health Link has made great strides to build and foster community partnerships. In doing so, the SBE has been able to help reach more Nevadans and spread greater visibility and education into Nevada Health Links resources, to ensure all Nevadans have access and information to quality and affordable health insurance.\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, Nevada Health Link, with the support of local partnerships, has been able to grow awareness to communities across the state  from North to South, urban to rural  about the physical and financial importance of having reliable health insurance coverage, said Ryan High, Executive Director of Nevada Health Link. We value the incredible partnerships and the many diverse organizations we have worked with over the years to ensure our community's health and wellness is top of mind each and every day.\nNevada Health Link has partnered with dozens of organizations across the state, including the Asian Community Resource Center (ACRC), The LGBTQ Center of Southern Nevada (The Center), Food Bank of Northern Nevada (FBNN), the Latin Chamber and the Mexican Patriotic Committee. During the most recent Open Enrollment Period that ended January 15, Nevada Health Link attended at least 68 community events, making an estimated 38,525 interactions with Nevadans to talk about health insurance. Nevada Health Link has also partnered with community organizations to host important discussions around health disparities, barriers amongst minorities and underrepresented communities, as well as spreading awareness about where and how Nevadans can get access to essential resources in the community. Because of these efforts, Nevada Health Link has opened doors for more individuals to safely and securely get insured.\nNevada Health Link is instrumental in connecting the LGBTQ community and underserved patrons of The Center to much-needed health insurance. Our partnership with Nevada Health Link provides valuable resources to help our clients access quality health insurance options when they dont qualify for Medicare, Medicaid or might not have employer-sponsored health insurance, said Mona Lisa Paulo, Director Of Clinic and HIV Services at The LGBTQ Center of Southern Nevada. We are proud to be a wellness service hub at the Arlene Cooper Community Health Center. And for the 70,000+ visitors that come to The Center yearly, we are proud to link them to valuable resources to promote and improve self-sufficiency among our Southern Nevada neighbors.\nNevada Health Link is currently in its Special Enrollment Period, eligible to those experiencing Qualifying Life Events (QLEs), including losing health insurance, change of employment or income, getting married, having a child or moving are encouraged to visit NevadaHealthLink.com to avoid a lapse in coverage.
