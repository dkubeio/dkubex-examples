I've now done at least a rough analysis of all 50 states + DC, and while some of the data is a bit outdated (remember, I started doing this back in late April/early May), most of it should still be fairly close to the present situation...at least in terms ofrequestedrate hikes.\nIn Nevada, after much concern that a bunch of rural counties wouldn't have any exchange carriers at all, Centene stepped in to cover them. They aren't listed in the table below, but since I believe they're new to the state, that shouldn't matter in terms of rateincreasessince there's no base rates to compare against anyway.\nFour of the six individual market carriers are off-exchange only, so the CSR reimbursement issue is a non-factor for them. That leaves two carriers (Health Plan of NV and HMO Nevada), both of which seem to be operating on the assumption that CSRswillcontinue to be paid. This means that the 28.9% and 60.3% average rate hikes being requested by each would be around 10 pointshigherif CSRsaren'tpaid next year (spread across all metal levels), for an ugly statewide rate increase of either 37.8% with CSRs or 44.4% without them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
