If I'm wrong and shehasdone a write-up on it, of course, I'll eat my words:\nMedicaid for all\nDemocratic [Nevada] Assemblyman Mike Sprinkle has introduced a bill,AB374, toopen up the states Medicaid program to anyone, regardless of their income level.\nIndividuals would be able to purchase coverage through Medicaid on the healthcare exchange for an annual premium set at 150 percent of the median expenditure paid on behalf of Medicaid enrollees in the preceding fiscal year. Though none of the current federal or state dollars going to fund Medicaid would be used to cover any portion of the new enrollees, they would still be entitled to the same benefits provided to other Medicaid recipients.\nThe legislation allows the director of the state Department of Health and Human Services to seek any necessary waivers of certain provisions of federal law to allow the program to be offered on the states health insurance exchange and to allow individuals to use the federal income tax credits and cost-sharing reductions created by the Affordable Care Act to purchase Medicaid coverage.\nWith all the fuss over pushing \"Medicare for All\", smarter minds than mine have noted that as awesome as Medicare is, it's actually Medicaidwhich might be a better model for a \"public option\" system. This seems like a pretty reasonable idea to me, and it would be minimally disruptive.\nIn addition, like Hawaii, Democrats in Nevada appear to be battening down the hatches just in case the GOP really does manage to pull off a repeal/replace deal after all:\nPreserving the ACA\nNevada Assembly Democrats are pushing to codify popular portions of the Affordable Care Act into state law amid a looming federal vote to dismantle the law.\nPortions copied from the federal health insurance law by theAB408include:\nA similar measure codifying parts of the ACA SB394 was introduced late Monday in the Senate.\n"}
