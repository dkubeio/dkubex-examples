This year, there's been very little of that; in most case so far, the regulators have pretty much authorized the premium rate increases as requested by carriers...and in many cases have approvedhigherincreases than requested. As a result, the overall national averagesapprovedhave been pretty close to the requests (around 24-25% nationally).\nHowever, Nevada is anexception to this trend. Back in early June, the weighted average increases requested were just over 15% state-wide (this was confirmed by the NV DOI a month later). Yesterday, however, the DOI released theapprovedrate hikes, and I'm happy to report that they lopped about 1/3 off the average hikes:\n\n\n"}
