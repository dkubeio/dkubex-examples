The agency recently launched a $49,000 Facebook and web ad campaign inviting consumers to browse the rates insurers are proposing for the nearly 600 plans available on the marketplace and comment on whether they're appropriate.\nAccording to my data, the ACA-compliant NV individual market is around 133,000 people, so the ACA-compliantsmall group market appears to be roughly 107,000.\n"}
