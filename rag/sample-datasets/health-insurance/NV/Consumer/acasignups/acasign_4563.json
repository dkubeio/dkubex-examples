This year it's actually at thelowerend of the scale so far. The numbers seem to add up as well--around 88,000 people enrolled via the exchange this year, so the other 45K are off-exchange, and Nevada's total indy market was around 118K in 2014, likely up to around 145K today including grandfathered policies, all of which seems right.\nIn fact, the only \"missing\" data here appears to beUnitedHealthcare. While United is dropping out of over 30 states, they'resupposedlysticking around on the on-exchangeindividual market in Nevada next year...but I can't find any filings for them on the indy market, only small group. Either they meant they'll be available on thesmall groupmarket in Nevada only, or they haven't submitted their 2017 rate filing yet, or they changed their mind and are pulling out after all. I'll have to look into this.\nUPDATE: OK, I've been informed that \"Health Plan of Nevada\" is actually UnitedHealthcare operating under a different name, so I guess that resolves that mystery...\nUPDATE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
