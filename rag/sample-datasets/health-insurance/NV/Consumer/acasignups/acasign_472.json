The Open Enrollment Period (OEP) through NevadaHealthLink.com is the most convenient time for Nevadans to enroll or make changes to their qualified health and dental plans; this year 17,925 Nevadans have enrolled in plans in the first 30 days of open enrollment. The 2023 Plan Year OEP began on November 1 and runs through January 15, 2023.\nNevada Health Link is operated by the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange), the state agency connecting individuals to affordable health and dental coverage. This is the Exchanges fourth year operating as a State-Based Exchange (SBE) or State Based Marketplace (SBM) and the agency has continued to expand access to coverage by offering more plans each year. During the first year operating as an SBE in 2019, the Exchange offered 27 qualified health plans across three insurance carriers. Now, the Exchange offers 163 different plans across seven insurance carriers, with at least 50 plans available to every county in Nevada.\nWhether it be a new consumer or an existing consumer who changed/upgraded their plan, 17,925 Nevadans have actively taken advantage of health insurance through Nevada Health Link this OEP so far. Of the 17,925 enrollees, 4,609 are new consumers, meaning they were not already enrolled in plans through NevadaHealthLink.com. Additionally, 13,316 consumers were re-enrollees who actively shopped and enrolled for plans.\nNevada Health Link is the only place Nevadans can take advantage of financial assistance or tax credits, known as subsidies, to offset the costs of monthly premiums, making it one of the most affordable options available to Nevadans seeking coverage. Last year, 90% of enrollees qualified for financial assistance to lower their insurance costs.\nNevada Health Link is one month into open enrollment, and I cannot stress enough the importance of being insured and prioritizing your health and safeguarding you and your family against unplanned medical costs, said Ryan High, the Executive Director of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. The main priority at the Exchange is that all Nevadans know their options and have access to affordable and qualified health insurance plans. We want uninsured and underinsured Nevadans to know that Nevada Health Link is an option available to them and there are plenty of resources available to help them pick the right plan, while also being the only place to offer subsidies to help bring down monthly premium costs.\nNevada Health Link is ideal for those who dont qualify for Medicare (65+) or Medicaid benefits; those who dont have employer-sponsored health insurance, including independent contractors and gig workers; and Nevadans seeking comprehensive, quality, and affordable plans.\nNevada Health Link offers free enrollment assistance to help Nevadans navigate the enrollment process by comparing plans, finding savings, and working with everyones budget and health needs. Getting through to the phone lines has been quick and efficient this year, to ensure Nevadans are not waiting on hold for extended periods of time. As of December 1, the Exchanges call center customer satisfaction during open enrollment has a score of 94%.\nGetting enrolled in health insurance can be a daunting and confusing process for many people, so dont hesitate to find a licensed enrollment professional in your area that can help you find a plan within your budget and ensure you have everything you need when it comes time to enroll, said Katie Charleson, Communications Officer of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. Nevada Health Link is here to answer any questions, help to see if you qualify for subsidies and overall, make the enrollment process as easy as possible. Its completely free to use the assistance from a certified and licensed Navigator or Broker, so even if you are on the fence, we highly recommend talking to these enrollment professionals who understand the plans available and find out what you may qualify for. Most consumers are surprised to find out they qualify for subsidies and plans are more affordable than they originally thought.\nOpen enrollment is one of the only times Nevadans can enroll in plans through Nevada Health Link, unless experiencing certain Qualifying Life Events (QLEs), such as losing health insurance, change of employment or income, getting married, having a child, or moving.\nTo find out if youre eligible and to learn more, visit NevadaHealthLink.com or call 1-800-547- 2927.
