That is low, compared to some other states who were hit hard by rate increases. Competition among providers helped hold rates down here.\nThere will be just three providers on the individual marketplace this year and here are the average increases for each:\nProminence: 2.94 percent\nHealth Plan of Nevada: 8.3 percent\nAnthem Blue Cross: 11.4 percent\nWhile Anthem has the biggest increase, it is also providing something new for the Marketplace  a PPO plan.\nPPO stands for Preferred Provider Organization, which allows the customer to go to a specialist without obtaining a referral from their primary care physician.\nMost plans in the state, on the Marketplace, are HMOs or Health Maintenance Organizations that do require referrals.\nWith the PPO, you can go outside the network to see a specialist, though your amount of coverage will be less. In an HMO, however, you have to pay the full cost of going outside a network.\nThis is actually excellent, and unexpected news, as several other insurance companies have decided todroptheir PPO offerings...notably BCBS of Texas(both on and off-exchange) and BCBS of Illinois (via the exchange only).Anthem Blue CrossaddingPPOs to the exchange is great to hear.\nUPDATE: According to Emily Holmes in the comments:\nNot true on IL. BCBSIL is dropping their broad PPO for individuals on and off the exchange and offering instead a lot less choice. They can call their new offering a PPO, but it is no more than an HMO that eliminates most of the best hospitals in the Chicago area. If you are a small business with group coverage, you get to keep the broad PPO. If you are an individual - self-employed, unemployed, retired - you have to go with the lesser plan or change companies. Discrimination against the individual.\nHere's the weird part, though: As you can see in my August 30 Nevada post, Anthem Blue Cross is nowhere to be seen in either the Individual or Small Group tables. I thought that perhaps they were a last-minute addition to the exchange...but even the official Nevada Insurance Dept. website doesn't list them at all. I suppose they could be operating under a different name, but none of the other companies list an 11.4% rate increase anywhere.\nAnyway, whatever; good news is good news.\nOne other bit of news for the Small Business market as well:\nWhile there are no new providers on the individual Marketplace in Nevada, Humana is coming in as a provider on the SHOP portion of the exchange for small business health insurance.\nSHOP enrollment has been extremely anemic nationally (except for Vermont and DC, which both have special circumstances), but this is still a good thing.\n"}
