It includes a straightforward enrollment number: \"more than 10,000\" right in the title.\nHowever, the wording of the article makes it unclear as to whether that number includesunsubsidizedQHP enrollments or just the 85% or so who qualify for tax credits:\nCompared to last years rollout, Nevada Health Link is showing stronger numbers so far in this years open enrollment.\nMore than 10,000 Nevadans have enrolled for subsidized health care plans through the state insurance program.\nThe enrollment numbers are good news andshow signs of improvements at Health Link, Nevadas online health care market.\nAt this time last year, only 6,000 people had signed up. It was Health Links first year online.\nThe comparison number below (6,000 last year) make it sound like 10K includes everyone, but the \"subsidized\" caveat makes it sound like it doesn't, in which case the total number should be roughly 11,700 or so.\nI'll go with the lower 10K number for now, however.\nUPDATE: I've received clarification from the reporter that yes, the 10K figuredoesinclude both subsidized and unsubsidized enrollments.\nUPDATE:\nSo, that's 10K in 25 days, or 400 per day on average. For comparison, last year NV averaged just 227 per day.\nUPDATE: OK, the exact number reported is 10,198.\nUPDATE:\n\n"}
