The presumption, of course, is that this is being done for political reasons. While this may be true, it could also simply be that there's alotof different policy figures to plug into the federal system, and some states haven't even finalized their rates yet.\nThat being said, residents ofsomestates can check out the 2015 premiumsnowand compare them against their current premium:\nIDAHO: Idaho is the only state moving fromHC.govtotheir own exchange. Idaho residents can check out their 2015 rates directly via the state exchange site.\nCALIFORNIA: CoveredCA has 2015 rates available right now as well.\nNEVADA:Nevada is one of two states (the other is Oregon) whose own exchange websites were so screwed up they gave up and decided to move private QHP enrollments over to the Federal exchange. However, I'm happy to report that NVresidents can look up 2015 policy details already directly on theNevada Dept. of Insurance website.It'simportant to keep in mind that for Nevada, these are thefull pricepremiumsbeforeany tax credits the enrollee may qualify for.\nBetween these three states, that's at least 1.22 millioncurrentenrollees out of around 7.3 million nationally (around 17% of the total) who do indeed have the ability to see what the 2015 rates are in an easy-to-use fashion.\nIn addition, MARYLAND has already announced that they'll allow comparison shopping on their completely overhauled \"2.0\" exchange website starting on November 9th, 6 days before the start of #OE2 (2nd open enrollment period...I'm trying to get that hashtag trending, folks...)\nThere may be some other state exchangeswhich have 2015 policy rates publicly available already, and there may even be some other states being run through HC.gov which have 2015 rates available on their own state sites (like Nevada does). If anyone knows of any, please let me know including the link if possible, thanks!\nUPDATE: NEW MEXICO's Insurance Superintendent has also posted their2015 policy premium charts, although these are in PDF format and therefore obviously a bit of a pain to wade through. Still should be helpful for some folks. Thanks to Frank P. for the heads up.\nUPDATE:\nThe same holds true for UTAH's insurance commissioner website. Again, one huge PDF, and it only gives premiums for 21 year olds; supposedly you can calculate other ages using the \"age factor curve\" whatever that is.\nFinally, thanks to commentor MyGeorgiaHealthPlan for posting a link to a sampling of 2015 policy premiums out of SOUTH CAROLINA.\nUPDATE x2: Thanks to \"Monks of Dschubba\" (?) for noting that the state of MAINEalso has their 2015 premiums available on a state website already.\nUPDATE x2: \nUPDATE x3: Thanks to David M. for pointing me towards the WASHINGTON STATEinsurance commissioner's website which also has their 2015 policy rates listed (in PDF format again).\nUPDATE x3: \n"}
