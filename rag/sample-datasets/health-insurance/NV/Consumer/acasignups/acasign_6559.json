NV's move to HC.gov will be permanent. Theoriginalplan was toonly moveto the federal exchange for 2015, then moving back to their own (2nd attempt) platform for 2016, which frankly always sounded a bit silly to me. There were lots of reasons for the states to run their own exchanges originally (federal cash to do so, autonomy/local control, etc.), but the federal fundingwill have dried up by then, and if everything is running smoothly at HC.gov, I'm not sure I see the point in uprooting the whole system at that point. Frankly, there's really only one major reason I could see to movebackto their own platform, but...\n2. While NV will be using the HC.govsoftware platform, they'll stilllegallybe considered a state-run exchange, which means that they're safe from any potential SCOTUS Halbig/Kingfallout. This is basically the entire point I was making way back on July 2nd with my \"Domain and a Splashpage\" solution.\n3. In less-positive news, it looks like NV's technical headaches are leading to a higher-than-typical attrition rate. The 38K high-water mark (forpayingenrollees) came at the end of July. If they're down 4,000 as of early September, that's 10.5% in 5 weeks, or an average of7.7% per month since then.\nFor comparison, other state attrition rates that I've trackedhave ranged from just 0.33% per month (Maryland) to 6.3% per month (Florida) so far.\nThe board of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange voted Thursday to end its search for a company to replace Xerox, which lost its contract in May following the health links glitch-ridden rollout.\nInstead, the board plans to stick permanently with borrowing enrollment and eligibility software from the federal healthcare.gov system.\nWe do have very limited resources with the number of people working on this. I would say the goal should be a successful enrollment for 2015, and that we stop anything with the alternative survey (of vendors) so our limited staff can focus on that successful enrollment, said board Chair Barbara Smith Campbell. I think thats what our Nevada consumers want too, most importantly.\n...Shawna DeRousse, chief operating officer of the exchange, said Nevada Health Link enrollments had dwindled to 34,000, down from 38,000 earlier this summer, and sign-ups may drop more as customers face re-enrollment in November.\n...Exchange Executive Director Bruce Gilbert told the board that Nevada will remain a state-run marketplace that merely uses healthcare.govs software. That means Nevadans will remain eligible for federal premium tax credits, regardless of any pending court rulings on who qualifies.\n"}
