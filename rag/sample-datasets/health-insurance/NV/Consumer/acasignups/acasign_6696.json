Adding insult to injury, all of them will have to re-enroll via HC.gov, although to be honest I kind of figured as much; I'd be very surprised if Oregon isn't facing the same issue, and as I've already noted, it's probably a good idea to have everyone re-enroll anyway just to make sure that they aren't surprised by changes in their tax subsidies:\nMore than 37,000 Nevadans who signed up for health care plans on the states insurance exchange will have to do so again.\nThe decision is the latest in a series of ongoing changes at the exchange as it tries to recover from a tumultuous first year of signing up consumers for plans that comply with the Affordable Care Act.\nThe move follows the exchanges announcement in May that it would use HealthCare.gov to enroll Nevada consumers into insurance plans during the next year.\nAs a safeguard, the federal government is requiring consumers to re-enroll, said CJ Bawden, exchange spokesman.\n\n"}
