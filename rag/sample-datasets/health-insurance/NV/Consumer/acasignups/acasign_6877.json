They have an estimated 304,000 people eligible for expansion, of which the state has already enrolled about 27%:\nThere were 467,000 Medicaid enrollees as of the end of April  50,000 more than anticipated, said Mike Willden, director of the state Department of Health and Human Services. Of those 83,000 people are newly eligible childless adults who did not previously qualify.\nWillden projected Nevada's Medicaid numbers will reach 600,000 by the end of the year.\n\"That is substantial,\" he said.\n"}
