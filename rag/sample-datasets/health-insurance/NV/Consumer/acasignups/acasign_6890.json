The state pushed their extension period far beyond any other state (most states stopped at 4/15; Oregon's was 4/30...Nevada kicked it out another month beyond that to 5/30), and still didn't come close to either their initial target or even my own \"fair share\" target of 73,000 QHP enrollees:\nAbout 35,700 consumers have purchased insurance coverage through the program. Enrollment is far less than an initial target of 118,000.\n(and yes, that 35,700 figure ispaid, not total; the total number stood at 47,245 a couple of weeks ago).\n"}
