(June 16, 2022)  BeWellnm, the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, announces operational updates as the state prepares for a successful 2023 Open Enrollment Period in the fall. As beWellnm begins its search for a permanent CEO, it has contracted with GetInsured, the nations leading provider of health insurance exchange technology and customer service solutions for health and human services agencies, to provide consultative and operational support during the period of transition. The organization will provide temporary, interim operational leadership for a 10-month period and offer strategic oversight and direction to beWellnm, along with long-term recommendations for maintenance and operations.\nHeather Korbulic, senior policy and strategy lead at GetInsured, will provide temporary executive leadership for beWellnm as it searches for a permanent leader. At GetInsured, Korbulic is charged with engaging local, state, and federal policymakers in developing strategies for technology-driven improvements to the provision of healthcare and other public benefits. Prior to joining the organization, she served for six years as the executive director of Nevadas trailblazing health insurance marketplace, the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (SSHIE). The beWellnm Board of Directors is very pleased to welcome the expert interim management team from GetInsured, who will be working closely with the beWellnm team as we recruit our next CEO and maintain and operate New Mexicos state-based exchange, said Board Chairman David Shaw.\nKorbulic did a fantastic job in both getting Nevada's Silver State Exchange off the ground and running it during the chaotic first year of the COVID pandemic. BeWellNM should be in good hands with her at the helm as they look for a permanent replacement.\nGetInsured is proud to support the beWellnm team during this transition, said Heather Korbulic, senior policy and strategy lead for GetInsured. Our goal is to ensure that beWellnm is successful in enrolling uninsured New Mexicans in affordable, comprehensive health insurance. We will not only assist in the implementation of a smooth Open Enrollment Period, but will also provide consultation and guidance as beWellnm matures operations as a state-based exchange.\nAs part of preparing for open enrollment, beWellnm is also working closely with its internal and external partners to ensure that all the 2023 healthcare coverage options are affordable and accessible to all eligible New Mexicans and include the 10 essential benefits such as doctor visits, hospital stays, maternity care, emergency room care, prescriptions, and more. Federal law and regulations provide protections against preexisting condition exclusions in health insurance coverage.\n"}
