Technically only 28,208 have actually paid their first premium so far, but another 4,332 havescheduledtheir payment which is certainly a huge step ahead of having \"enrolled but not even arranged for a payment\" (and my model has 7% of this total being lopped out for potential non-payment anyway). So,32,540it is until further notice.\nAnd the number of people who enrolled in and paid for a qualified health plan through the exchange hit 28,208 on April 5, up from 25,899 people on March31. Another 4,332 consumers have scheduled payments.\n"}
