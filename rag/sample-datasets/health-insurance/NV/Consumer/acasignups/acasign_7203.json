Consumers eligible to sign up then include people who have selected an exchange plan but not paid for it, as well as people who qualified through the exchange for a federal premium subsidy but who have not bought a plan.\nCompany officials said they believe they could convert about 57,000 of the 77,000 targeted consumers into actual enrollees.\n"}
