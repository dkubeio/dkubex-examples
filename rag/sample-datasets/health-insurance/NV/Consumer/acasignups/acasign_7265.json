The CO-OP has actually sold more plans through the exchange than any other insurer: Its responsible for 37 percent of plans sold, beating out industry titans UnitedHealthcare and Anthem, the states two biggest insurers. The CO-OP had sold about 9,500 plans on the exchange and just under 1,000 off of it as of Tuesday.\nI'm gonna call \"just under 1,000\" 990 (shrug).\n"}
