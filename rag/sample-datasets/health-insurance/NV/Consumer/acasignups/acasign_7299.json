However, with this addition, their daily average has shot up to 323/day, a 52% increase. Even more impressive, if youonlyinclude the 2nd week of the month, that's 3,038/7 = 434/day, or more than twice the daily average. The Surge is definitely here, folks.\nUpdate as of 3/15: 33,053 consumers have confirmed Qualified Health Plan selections through Nevada Health Link, 22,533 have paid.\n Nevada Health Link (@NVHealthLink) March 17, 2014\n"}
