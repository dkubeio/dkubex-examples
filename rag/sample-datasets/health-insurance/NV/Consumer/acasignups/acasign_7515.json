On 12/26, the official Nevada Health Link posted this to their Twitter feed:\nUpdate: As of the 12/23/13 deadline to enroll, 12740 consumers confirmed QHP selections, 6219 have paid. Payment deadline is 12/30/13.\n Nevada Health Link (@NVHealthLink) December 26, 2013\nFair enough; 6,224 paid, 6,521 unpaid through 12/23.\nThen, on January 7, they posted another solid update:\nUpdate as of 1/4: 915,977 unique individuals visited Nevada Health Link. 17,673 consumers confirmed QHP selections, 10,547 have paid.\n Nevada Health Link (@NVHealthLink) January 7, 2014\nAgain, that makes sense. 10,547 paid, 7,126 unpaid as of January 4.\nHowever, when the December HHS report came out, it gave the official number as 22,566...as of 12/28. Huh.\nI wasn't sure how to proceed, but the HHS report supposedly trumps anything that comes out before it, so I figured \"OK, I guess some additional numbers came in that didn't make it to the Twitter feed...and I guess HHS is counting them whether they paid or not, so I guess 22.5K vs. 17.6K is reasonable.\"\n...until yesterday, when the Nevada Health Link posted yet another update:\nUpdate as of 1/11: Nevada Health Link site eclipses 1 million unique visitors. 18,864 confirmed QHP selections, 11,409 consumers paid.\n Nevada Health Link (@NVHealthLink) January 14, 2014\nNow we have a problem. They're claiming a total of only 18.8K as of 01/11 (and only 11.4K if counting paid accounts only) when HHS claims 22.5K as of 12/28. The only way this makes sense would be if the 18.8K number refers toaccounts/households, sincethe HHS report refers to actualpeople.\nI asked NHL about the discrepancy, and their response was pretty to the point:\n@charles_gaba Please look at the weekly enrollment postings for Nevada Health Link here. Correct numbers are posted weekly.\n Nevada Health Link (@NVHealthLink) January 15, 2014\nHm. So, they're insistant that they have the right numbers, but don't explain the difference. I've already replied and will note if they clarify the issue.\n"}
