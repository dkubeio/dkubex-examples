Today marks the 12th anniversary since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010. The ACA has been one of the most significant health care reform landmarks in the United States and has had a great impact on providing more affordable and qualified health care in Nevada.\nThe ACA is credited for the creation and ongoing operations of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Exchange), Nevadas state agency that helps individuals get connected to budget-appropriate health coverage through the online marketplace, Nevada Health Link.\nThis year, Nevada achieved its most successful enrollment with over 100,000 Nevadans enrolled in health insurance during Nevada Health Links two-and-a-half month Open Enrollment Period (OEP) that ran from November to mid-January. There was nearly a 25% increase in enrollments from last years enrollment period, ranking Nevada the most increased in enrollments out of all State Based Exchanges (SBE) and 17th out of all exchanges in the country.\nAs we enter the 12th year since enactment, the ACA continues to emphasize the importance of affordable coverage for all Nevadans, said Ryan High, Executive Director of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. As we slowly transition out of a global health crisis, many Nevadans have recognized that illness and life-altering events can be unpredictable. That is why the Exchange remains focused on protecting all individuals and their families by offering affordable health insurance plans on NevadaHealthLink.com and being the only place Nevadans can receive federal subsidies to reduce the cost of monthly premiums.\nLower monthly premiums were made possible as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) signed by President Biden in 2021. Within the last year, Americans were able to benefit from expanded subsidies, lower premiums and access to applying for health insurance outside of the traditional open enrollment windows.\nAlthough the Open Enrollment Period has concluded, there are still some who may be eligible to sign up for plans through Nevada Health Link, including those experiencing Qualifying Life Events (QLEs), such as losing health insurance, change of employment or income, getting married, having a child or moving. A full list of QLEs may be found online here.\nVisit NevadaHealthLink.com to find out more information on ACA-compliant health insurance plans and for the latest news and updates.\n"}
