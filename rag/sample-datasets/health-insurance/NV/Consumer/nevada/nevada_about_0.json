Edward and his wife traveled to California to visit some family for the holidays. On Christmas morning Edward could not handle the pain any longer and visited the emergency room. A cat scan revealed that he had a big abscess in his intestine and rushed him into surgery to remove three feet of his intestine. In May 2015 Edward had a heart attack, after two operations he is doing a lot better. Thanks to his health insurance plan with Nevada Health Link his out of pocket costs were affordable. Edward encourages everyone to purchase health insurance, life is full of surprises and you never know when you will require medical attention.\nMichael Niskars story\nAs a child, Michael was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse, which is a very common heart condition.

Michael learned about the Affordable Care Act and visited Nevada Health Links website where he was able to purchase a qualified health plan, for the first time in his life he was able to afford health insurance with a pre-existing condition. Michael visited a doctor and was diagnosed with a herniated disc and spinal stenosis. In 2015 his cardiac issues worsened and he required surgery to replace a mitral valve.
