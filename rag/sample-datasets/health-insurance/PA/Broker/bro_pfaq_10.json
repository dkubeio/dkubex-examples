The agency can have a single producer operating on their own or have multiple producers. Agencys are not limited in the number of producers they can have within the agency.\nAn agency account is automatically created when an agency manager goes to Pennie.com to create their account. If you are an agent within an agency that has multiple producers, you should check to see if your agency already has an agency account with Pennie. You can do this by asking someone within your agency or by reaching out to the dedicated Pennie producer line at 1-844-844-4440.\nFor agents who work alone and do not have a formal agency name you can create your agency name would just be your first and last name. This will be public on our site so that customers can easily find you and request you as their producer.\nAlso see:\nPennie account creation\nWhat is the difference between an agency manager account and an agent account?\nHow do I become a certified broker on Pennie?"}
