If you think this is an error you can always contact the Pennie Producer Helpline (1-844-844-4440) for additional assistance in determining why the customer no longer designated.\nFor Pre-Registered Producers\nIf you completed pre-registration by September 2 your customers who were migrated from the FFM should appear in your Pennie Book of Business. If you do not see your customer, then their broker-designation was not successfully migrated.\nPennie migrated data in September from Healthcare.gov. Pennie relied on the data provided by Healthcare.gov and producers during pre-registration to link customers with their broker. If a customers data from Healthcare.gov did not match with the data provided during pre-registration Pennie was not able to maintain that relationship.\nThe good news is Pennie makes it easy for a customer to re-designate you as their broker.
