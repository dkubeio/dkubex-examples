If you serve both in-state and out-of-state clients, then you will need both a Healthcare.gov and Pennie account in order to serve clients in Pennsylvania and in states using the federally-facilitated marketplace (FFM). If you are a new producer (agent or broker) in Pennsylvania, and only wish to serve Pennsylvanians, you only need to be certified through Pennie.\nNOTE: Others states are also transitioning to a State Based Marketplace. Many SBM states have their own certification/training requirements, you should check the requirements for each state you have clients in to continue to serve them."}
