This training is required for producers to be Pennie-certified. \n\nUnlike the CMS training, this training is Pennsylvania and Pennie-specific, and the content has been reduced by 40% to be more streamlined. There is also a systems-training module designed to make it easy for producers to log-in and serve their customers on the Pennie platform. The scoring for the comprehensive exam has also changed. Producers must score at least 80% to pass the course but can take the test as many times as necessary to pass. There are 50 questions,each worth 2 points."}
