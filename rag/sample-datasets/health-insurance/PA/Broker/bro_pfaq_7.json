What do I do now?", "text": "Im receiving an error message when typing in my email address.  What do I do now?\n          \n        \nIf you are receiving an error message when setting up your account, it may be because you have a hyphen in your work email address.\nTo Fix: Use your personal email account or create a new email account that does not include a hyphen. Once you have this hyphen-less email account, that will be your login. Do note that you will be able to link your work email account within your Pennie Profile to receive notifications."}
