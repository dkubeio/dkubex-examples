The best way to get to the courses is to visit either \nNew Broker Certification (pennie.com)\n or \nBroker Recertification (pennie.com)\n then follow the links in the turquoise section to be brought to each module directly.\nThe alternative is to search on TrainPA in the Course Catalog section. Once there, search for \nPA-Pennie:\n and scroll to find the courses you must complete. *\nNOTE\n not all courses are available to Brokers, please ensure you are taking the correct course from Module 1 to Pennie: Exam."}
