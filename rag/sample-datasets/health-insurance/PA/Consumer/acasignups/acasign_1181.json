Most of these tour stops also offer the COVID-19 vaccine to those that pre-register.\nPennie has delivered new financial savings to hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians due to the implementation of the new American Rescue Plan (ARP) benefits. The American Rescue Plan allows for anincrease in the amount of premium tax credits through Pennie for eligible Pennsylvanians at most income levels during the 2021 and 2022 plan years.\nOn April 16, Pennie updated its shopping and plan comparison platform to allow those browsing their health coverage options to compare plans based on their eligibility with the new savings available. The average net premium customers are paying after financial assistance is almost half what it was prior to the American Rescue Plan, down to $85 a month from $168 a month, noted Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Jessica Altman.\nWe are pleased to be able to provide this never-before-seen level of financial assistance to our customers and to help those across the commonwealth access affordable coverage. Currently, 90 percent of Pennie customers are receiving financial assistance, and the amount of financial assistance available has increased by $49 million a month. The sooner the uninsured take advantage of this opportunity, the sooner they can start saving while protecting their health, noted Pennie Executive Director Zachary W. Sherman.\nAs of June 21, approximately 15 percent of customers are receiving the Unemployment Insurance benefit, making them eligible to receive the maximum amount of financial assistance available through Pennie. On average, these customers are saving around $604 per month.
