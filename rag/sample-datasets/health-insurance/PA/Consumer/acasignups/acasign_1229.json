Another 38,946 people selected plans between 2/15 - 6/14; a similar percent of those paying their first couple of months would be around 36,400 people.\nIf so, that means roughly 288,000 of the OEP enrollees are still sticking it out, or around 85.3% of those who signed up by the end of the official enrollment period.\nPut another way. thanks to the beefed-up SEP enrollment, current ACA exchange enrollment as of mid-June is 96% as high as the official OEP enrollment number was.\nAssuming PA's experience is representative nationally, that means current ACA exchange enrollment across all 50 states + DC would be around 11.52 million people, or ~900K lower than I had it pegged at as of May.\nAgain, however, there's no way of knowing how representative Pennsylvania is...especially when you consider that NON-expansion states have increased their SEP enrollment 4x over 2019 vs. just a 2.3x increase in Medicaid expansion states such as PA.\n"}
