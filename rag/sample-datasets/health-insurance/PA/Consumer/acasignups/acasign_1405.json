These provisions include significant impacts, including an increase in savings, for Pennsylvanians seeking individual market coverage and those already enrolled through Pennie, as well as those who may lose their employment and rely on COBRA to maintain their employer coverage. Pennie is excited to announce that these savings are now available at pennie.com for those looking to enroll in quality, affordable coverage.  \nPennie is currently in the midst of the COVID-19 Enrollment Period and due to these savings now being available, Pennie has extended the deadline for broad coverage until August 15, 2021.  \nPennsylvania taxpayers and their spouses, who are eligible to receive unemployment compensation in 2021, will be eligible for the maximum levels of financial assistance through Pennie, including advance premium tax credits (APTC) and cost sharing reductions (CSR) to significantly reduce the cost of health coverage and care. Many of these households will be able to enroll in a silver plan in their area with a $0 premium for the remainder of 2021, if they otherwise qualify.  \nThe system enhancements to pennie.com for shopping customers were part of Pennies Phase 1 of implementation of the American Rescue Plan provisions. Current customers will also be able to access the enhanced subsidies during this phase, as long as they actively resubmit their Pennie application. The second phase in Pennies implementation plan relates to re-running eligibility for current Pennie customers. Pennie will be automatically updating their plans with the enhanced subsidies and will implement these savings by no later than June. Pennie will be notifying their customers when these changes will be availablein their accounts,and what steps they need to taketo receive them, if necessary.  \nPennie hopes these updates made to the online application system will bring coverage within reach for those who areuninsuredbutcould not previously affordit.Those interested in having affordable, quality health coverage should visit pennie.com and enroll in health insurance to receive these new savings.
