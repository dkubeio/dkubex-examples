Like most of the other exchanges, Pennie's initial press release was pretty bare-bones, as the bill had just been signed into law and there were a ton of logistical details to be worked out.\nToday, at their monthly board meeting, Pennie provided some further info on how they plan to proceed:\nPennies American Rescue Plan Policy Goals\nOf the 337,000 Pennsylvanians who selected Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) during the 2021 Open Enrollment Period (OEP), around 86% (290,000) are already receiving pre-ARP subsidies:\n \nPennie estimates that without the ARP, their current enrollees would receive around $1.61 billion in federal APTC subsidies over the course of 2021 (assuming around a 10% net attrition rate, which sounds low to me, but then again, in the age of COVID anything's possible...and the ARP's extra subsidies are gonna reduce the attrition rate anyway):\n \nWith the expanded ARP subsidies, Pennie figures current enrollees who are already subsidized will see an increase of around $270 million in subsidies, plus another $67 million for current enrollees who aren't subsidized:\n \nIf so, this would mean a grand total of $1.95 billion in 2021 APTC subsidies, or roughly 21% more for current enrollees.\nAs for the uninsured population of PA, Pennie estimates that around 266,000 uninsured Pennsylvanians are already eligible for some ACA subsidies; they would see their average premiums drop by a further $1,100/year. In addition, they figure there's around 110,000 uninsured PA residents who earn more than 400% FPL (meaning they weren't eligible for subsidies until now); they'd be eligible for average savings of nearly $1,900/year:\n \nIf every single one of these folks were to #GetCovered via Pennie, it would reduce Pennsylvania's uninsured tally by an additional 376,000 people, at an additional federal APTC subsidy cost of around $2.1 billion.\nThat would bring Pennsylvania's total APTC subsidies to around $4.07 billion for around 680,000 enrollees, or roughly $6,000 per year apiece.\nAs for the actual timeline of retooling the Pennie website, it looks like they're targeting late April for new enrollees to be able to enroll with the expanded/enhanced subsidies...including those eligible for unemployment compensation (Phase 1). Then, they're targeting early June for current enrollees to be able to update their accounts with the enhanced subsidies on a monthly basis (Phase 2).\nThis is kind of interesting--it's the exact opposite order that HealthCare.Gov has laid out (they're targeting April 1st for everything except unemployment, and July for that).\nHere's how they intend to proceed after Phase 1:\nHuh. That's kind of interesting--the ARP says that anyone on unemployment insurance in 2021 will have their income declared to be 133% FPL, but Pennie is setting them at 138.1% if it's higher than 138%. The reason for this is obvious: If they were declared to be 133%, they'd have to be kicked over to Medicaid in expansion states instead. I'm just not sure if they're supposed to do this or not under the letter of the ARP itself.\nHere's what they have in mind after Phase 2:\nIt also sounds like they're considering extending the COVID Enrollment Period out to August 15th to match HealthCare.Gov, but haven't made a decision on that yet:\nProposal: Extend the COVID-19 Enrollment Period\nUPDATE: OK, strike that...it's official...via email:\nUPDATE: OK, strike that...it's official...via email:\nPennie Extends COVID-19 Enrollment Period to August 15\nPennie Extends COVID-19 Enrollment Period to August 15\n\nHarrisburg, PA March 25, 2021  On March 25, the Pennie Board of Directors unanimously voted to extend the current COVID-19 Enrollment Period to August 15, 2021, aligning with the federal extension which was announced earlier this week. Pennie is committed to providing ample time and opportunity for Pennsylvanians to access quality health coverage and financial assistance.\nPennie is currently working to implement and make a reality the significant and exciting savings provided through the American Rescue Plan. These savings will increase financial assistance to those who currently receive it and will ensure no one will be paying more than 8.5 percent of their income on premiums through Pennie for the next two years. An extended enrollment period will give individuals more time to enroll in health coverage and take advantage of the new opportunities for financial assistance once they are implemented. Pennie is committed to providing tangiblerelief for those who are struggling with the pandemic and its economic repercussions and feels it is necessary to provide an extension of the COVID-19 Enrollment Period to ensure accessible and affordable coverage is an option to all Pennsylvanians during this public health emergency.\nAnother piece of the American Rescue Plan is providing more generous assistance to those who lost their jobs but want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through COBRA. Currently, those laid off workers have to pay the full cost of that coverage but under the American Rescue Plan, they will pay no premiums for this coverage from April through September. Following September, Pennie encourages anyone on COBRA to consider switching over to Pennie for their low-cost or no-cost premiums. Pennie will be adding this transition as a qualifying life event for customers to enroll through a Special Enrollment Period.\nPennie is the only source for financial assistance to help with the cost of coverage and care and can also link customers to free certified experts to assist with the application or plan selection process. Pennie encourages anyone who has found themselves uninsured and is seeking coverage, to visitpennie.comto learn more or to call Pennie customer care at 1-844-844-8040 before August 15. \n\nAs for the 6-month 100% COBRA subsidy provision of the ARP, Pennie is also planning on how to deal with the September 30th cut-off of that as well:\nStakeholder Feedback:\nStaff Proposal:\n"}
