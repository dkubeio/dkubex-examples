Through this law, marketplace premiums will be capped at 8.5% of a household's income, meaning current Pennie customers will see lower monthly premiums and those without coverae or who were previously ineligible will now have access to financial help if they shop at Pennie.com.\nIn some cases, lower-income enrollees will have their monthly premiums eliminated entirely. Additionally, anyone who was eligible for unemployment income in 2021 will be eligible for coverage thorugh Pennie with a $0 premium for the remainder of the year.\nThese changes allow Pennie to further support current customers and delivers an extraordinary opportunity for individuals seeking coverage to protect themselves and their families as we continue to grapple with the impacts of COVID-19. We will move quickly to implement these changes in the interest of delivering this financial relief as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\n"}
