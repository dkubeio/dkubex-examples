Anyone is eligible to enroll in coverage through Pennie beginning February 15 and until May 15.\nThe PR includes some graphics, including one with the hard numbers:\nLast year, 331,825 people selected QHPs during OEP 2020 in Pennsylvania, so this is indeed an increase of5,897 enrollees, or about 1.8% year over year.

Pennies support does not end with Open Enrollment. The economic and public health implications of the pandemic have been and continue to be destabilizing, impacting the lives of so many Pennsylvanians. Anyone without health insurance will have more time to sign up through Pennie, giving those eligible access to financial assistance and comprehensive coverage, including for COVID-19 related treatment and services.
