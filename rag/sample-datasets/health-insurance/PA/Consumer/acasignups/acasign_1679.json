Improving access to affordable, quality health coverage is a priority for Pennie, Pennsylvanias new state-based health insurance marketplace.\nGet Covered 2021 is a national initiative promoting COVID-19 safety precautions and the importance of having health coverage.  Pennie, in partnership with Pennsylvania leadership, along with 15 other states and Washington D.C., hundreds of health associations, sports figures, and celebrities have joined together to help spread the word to mask up and get covered.\nToday, at a press conference, Jessica Altman, Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, announced that Governor Wolf has officially issued a proclamation that December 10th is Get Covered 2021 Pennsylvania Day. As Governor Wolf states in his proclamation, the world is facing the most significant health crisis in modern history due to COVID-19, which has also caused a global economic downturn, impacting people and their ability to access health insurance. The proclamation stresses the importance of wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and making sure Pennsylvanians have access to affordable, quality health insurance so they can receive the care needed when they need it. The official proclamation can be found here.\nPennie encourages all Pennsylvanians to participate in Get Covered 2021 Day in Pennsylvania by spreading the word on social media by using the hashtag #GetCovered2021 and visiting pennie.com to access health coverage now during Open Enrollment. To learn more about this initiative, visit GetCovered2021.org.\nPennie is quickly approaching its first open enrollment deadline. December 15 is the last day for individuals and families to purchase health coverage that begins in January 2021. Current and potential customers are urged to shop and select a plan by December 15 to ensure continuous coverage.\nIn line with Governor Wolfs priorities, Pennie is a demonstration of Pennsylvanias dedication to identifying and implementing initiatives that drive down health care costs, without compromising access and quality of care, said Pennies Executive Director Zachary Sherman. Pennie strives to support all Pennsylvanians and understands many who lost employer-sponsored coverage due to COVID-19 may be new to the individual market and unaware of the benefits of the marketplace. All commercial, comprehensive health insurance available in the Commonwealth, including plans purchased through Pennie, fully cover: the COVID-19 test if patients are experiencing symptoms or have an indication of exposure; treatment for the symptoms that develop due to COVID-19; and the cost of the COVID-19 vaccine once available.\nOver 300,000 Pennsylvanians have signed up for coverage through Pennie so far this Open Enrollment period, and Pennie is eager to see that number increase as the first enrollment deadline approaches on Tuesday. Pennie encourages anyone who is uninsured and seeking coverage, and potentially financial aid, to go to pennie.com or to call the Pennie Call Center at 1-844-844-8040 before December 15 to enroll in one of the high-quality options available in their area.\nI should note that during an official webinar this morning, the Pennie team noted that around 30,000 of those 300,000 enrollees are new to the ACA exchange, so that's around 270,000 renewals. They didn't break those out between auto-renewal and active renewals, however.\n"}
