Burwell lawsuit days of 2015.\nRegular readers may recall that Pennsylvania expects to pay their share of their new Section 1332 Reinsurance Waiver program using the ~$60 million or so which they expect to save from moving off of HealthCare.Gov onto their own exchange platform. It's a clever funding mechanism which, in the end, amounts to simply \"passing the savings along to the customers\", so to speak; that $60 million in savings is leveraged with $145 - $190 million in federal reinsurance dollars to reduce unsubsidized premiums for Pennsylvania ACA enrollees by around 5-10%. This isn't the most robust reinsurance program in the country, but hey, 5-10% isn't chump change either.\nIn any event, as always, Louise Norris has the skinny on \"Pennie\":\nThe website will debut in late August, and Pennsylvania residents will use Pennie (instead of HealthCare.gov) to enroll in coverage for 2021 once open enrollment starts on November 1, 2020. As noted above, the enrollment window willcontinue through January 15, 2021, giving Pennsylvania residents an additional month to sign up for coverage.\nInteresting. I figured they'd stick with the official federal deadline for the first year, as Nevada did when they split off from the federal exchange last fall. Fair enough.\nAs of June 2020, the exchange has a full-time staff of 19 people and is beginning a second hiring wave. The system is undergoing the various testing procedures that are necessary in order to ensure a seamless transition in the fall. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department is maintaininga pagedevoted to the creation of the state-run exchange, which includes links to all of the board meeting and advisory committee meeting minutes.\n...In August 2019, Governor Wolfannouncedthe appointees for the Pennsylvania Health Insurance Exchange Authoritys board of directors. The group is overseeing the implementation and operations of the state-run marketplace. And Zachary Sherman, who previously served as the director of Rhode Islands health insurance exchange,is leading Pennsylvanias exchange.\n...Pennsylvaniaalready switched to having a state-based exchange on the federal platform (SBM-FP) as of the fall of 2019. This means Pennsylvania is responsible for a variety of exchange functions and oversight, but uses HealthCare.gov for enrollment (five other states have the same exchange model).\n...In addition to financial savings, states that run their own exchanges also have flexibility regarding theiropen enrollment schedules(Pennies first enrollment windowwill continue until January 15, 2021, which is an extra month beyond what it would be if the state had continued to use HealthCare.gov), call center operations, and navigator grants. They also have much better access to enrollment data, which can be used to better understand enrollment trends and seek opportunities to better serve the states population.\nSo there you have it...Pennie is coming this fall to Keystone Staters.\n"}
