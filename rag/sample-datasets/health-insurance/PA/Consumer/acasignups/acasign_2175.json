H.R.1884 includes a suite of about a dozen provisions to protect, repair and strengthen the ACA, but the House Dems also broke the larger piece of legislation down into a dozen smaller bills as well.\nSome of these \"mini-ACA 2.0\" bills only make minor improvements to the law, or make improvements in ways which are important but would take a few years to see obvious results. Others, however, make huge improvements and would be immediately obvious, and of those, the single most dramatic and important one is H.R.1868.\nThe official title is the \"Health Care Affordability Act of 2019\", but I just call both it and H.R.1884 (the \"Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making Health Care More Affordable Act of 2019\") by the much simpler and more accurate moniker \"ACA 2.0\".\nThe official lead sponsor of H.R.1868 is Rep. Lauren Underwood (IL-14). While it currently only has 35 cosponsors, the larger H.R.1884 bill thatincludes H.R.1868 has 160 total sponsors to date, so there'sstrong support within the Democratic caucus.\nH.R.1868 itself is a very short and simple bill which does just two things, both of which involve changes to the current formula for ACA individual market subsidies:\n \nThis may not sound like much, but it would make a huge difference for millions of Americans. The main beneficiaries would be the middle class...people earning too much to qualify for subsidies today, but not enough to easily afford ACA-compliant policies (basically, between 400 - 800% FPL). However, many of those who are already receiving subsidies would also see additional savings.\nIt's important to keep in mind that there are three main trouble spots when it comes to the individual market under the ACA: Premiums (mostly for the unsubsidized); deductibles/co-pays (for those earning more than 200% FPL); and provider network width. H.R.1868 addresses the first of these three, and it does so very well.\nThere are other provisions in the larger \"omnibus\" ACA 2.0 bill (and especially in the Senate version, S.1213) which deal with the other two, but for this project I'm only looking at the first: High premiums.\nWhen I ran the numbers for my March analysis of H.R.1868, I used the national average premiums for Silver plans, which cover around 70% of the average person's medical expenses per year. However, that premium can vary greatly from state to state, county to county, carrier to carrier and even by the specific Silver plan you're looking at.\nThe actual measure is to look at the benchmark plan for the specific geographic area that the enrollee(s) live in. Under the ACA, the benchmark plan is the second lowest-cost Silver plan available on the ACA exchange.\nIt's important to understand that in addition to where they live, the benchmark plan premium will also vary greatly depending on...\nTherefore, I've decided to launch a new project: I'm going to run the numbers for H.R.1868 for all 435 Congressional Districts.\nIn terms of methodology, the first challenge is the geography. Most states have multiple premium rating areas (that is, carriers can charge different rates for the same plan in one vs. another within the state); not every carrier offers plans in every part of the state; and of course there's no connection between the insurance rating areas and Congressional District boundaries (especially with some gerrymandered districts winding their way from one end of the state to the other).\nMy solution to this is to simply pick the zip code of each Representative's home town(there arenearly 42,000 zip codes nationally).\nSecond: I have to account for the wide variance of household makeups. There's an endless array of possibilities, but I settled on four specific households. Collectively, I think these are about as representative as I could reasonably be.\nThis is, needless to say, an extremely ambitious and time-consuming project. It'll take months for me to get to every district, assuming I even do get to all of them.\nToday, I'm looking at Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional District.\nPA-07 includes all ofLehigh CountyandNorthampton Countyas well as parts ofMonroe County. This swing district is represented by freshman DemocratSusan Wild, who lives in South Whitehall Township near Allentown.\n\nFirst up: A single 30-year old:\nFirst up: A single 30-year old:\nFirst up: A single 30-year old:\n \nWithout any subsidies, this young adult would be paying $478/month regardless of his or her income. Under the current ACA subsidy formula, they qualify for Medicaid up to an income of a little over $17,000/year. Over that their monthly premiums start at $50/mo, then gradually increase to the full $478/mo. Currently, theyhit the 400% FPL subsidy cliff, seeing their premiums jump by $71/month the moment they break 400% FPL.
