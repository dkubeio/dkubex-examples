DHS goal throughout the renewal process is to make sure that all Pennsylvanians stay covered, saidActing Secretary Arkoosh. I urge all Pennsylvanians who get their health coverage through the state Medicaid program to be on the lookout for communications from DHS about your renewal, and to make sure you complete it on time when its your turn to renew.\nThe federal public health emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic allowed for individuals to remain enrolled in Medicaid even if they became ineligible, except in certain circumstances. This is also known as the Medicaid continuous coverage requirement. A federal law ended the continuous coverage requirement on March 31, 2023. All Pennsylvanians receiving Medicaid or CHIP must now complete their annual renewal when it is due to determine if they are still eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage.No one will lose Medicaid or CHIP coverage without first having an opportunity to renew their coverage or update their information.\nPennsylvanians can update their contact information, report changes in their personal circumstances, and check their renewal date:\nRenewals will be completed over 12 months and for most people this will occur in a persons typical renewal month. If a person is found ineligible for coverage or does not complete their renewal on time, their Medicaid coverage will end. Pennsylvanians who are no longer eligible for Medicaid will be referred to other sources of affordable medical coverage, like CHIP and Pennie, so they have no lapse in coverage.\nThose who are no longer eligible for Medicaid coverage can apply for coverage throughpennie.com,while some individuals will have their information securely transferred from Medicaid or CHIP for an easier enrollment process. Pennie is Pennsylvanias official health insurance marketplace and the only place to get financial assistance to help lower the cost of high-quality coverage and care. Customers can simplycall Pennie Customer Service at 1-844-844-8040 or find Pennie-certified pros atpennie.com/connect.\nHaving health coverage means breathing a sigh of relief in vulnerable moments of illness or injury. Pennie is Pennsylvanias unbiased marketplace on which all health plans must cover a full range of medical services and preventative care, saidPennie External Affairs Director Chachi Angelo. Pennie is specifically tailored for Pennsylvanians by providing access to a wide variety of affordable, quality plan options, particularly for those who are no longer eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. If cost is a barrier to coverage, know that many customers can find plans for under $10 a month.\nCommunity Health Net (CHN) is the preeminent, community-focused healthcare network advancing the wellness of the Lake Erie region.
