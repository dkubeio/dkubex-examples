Tom Wolf had pressed for the bill's passage this month in the hope that its savings measures can take partial effect in 2020 and full effect in 2021.\nWolf plans to sign the bill Tuesday, his office said.\nUpdate: It's done.\n...But Wolf's administration says the state can operate the exchange for less money than the federal government. Currently, the federal government takes 3.5% of the premium paid on plans sold through the exchange, or an estimated $94 million this year.\nThe state can operate the exchange for $30 million to $35 million and use the savings to qualify for extra federal reinsurance funds to reimburse insurers for certain high-cost claims, Wolf's administration says.\nThe state's share would be about 20% to one-quarter of the reinsurance program cost, according to Wolf administration estimates.\n...Wolf's administration said it believes consumers would see premiums that are 5% to 10% lower than what they would otherwise pay.\nWell, it's early December now, and while PA has completedhalfthe move by establishing thelegalentitiy needed to operate the exchange, it'll be another year before they're ready to finish the move onto their own tech platform and website:\nPAs A Step Closer To Starting A State-Based Health Insurance Exchange\nPennsylvanias new, state-run health insurance exchange is getting rolling ahead of its launch in 2021.\nThe commonwealth has chosen a California-based company, GetInsured to run it.\n...Zachary Sherman, who heads the newly-created Pennsylvania Health Insurance Exchange Authority, said the contract with GetInsured will cost around $25 million annually, plus startup expenses thatll be spread over several years.\nThats compared to what we currently pay for Healthcare.gov, which is in the $90 to $95 million range, he said.\nSherman said the administration chose GetInsured because it has already contracted with other states, like Nevada and Minnesota.\nHe said the new exchange is expected to save people between five and ten percent every year on premiums.\nWell, not exactly...the 5-10% savings is expected to come from the ACA Section 1332 Reinsurance Waiverthey're putting in for, which wouldbe partiallyfundedby the $65 - $70 million in savings they expect to see by moving to their own exchange. That's not quite the same thing, but it amounts to it from the enrollee's perspective.\n"}
