DHS goal throughout the renewal process is to make sure that all Pennsylvanians stay covered,said Acting Secretary Arkoosh. I urge all Pennsylvanians who get their health coverage through the state to do a few things right now so that your renewal goes smoothly: make sure your contact information is up-to-date with DHS,check your renewal date so that you are ready to renew when the time comes, and complete your renewal by the deadline when its your turn to renew.\nThe federal public health emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic allowed for individuals to remain enrolled in Medicaid even if they became ineligible, except in certain circumstances. This is also known as the Medicaid continuous coverage requirement. A federal law ended the continuous coverage requirement on March 31, 2023. All Pennsylvanians receiving Medicaid or CHIP must complete their annual renewal when it is due to determine if they are still eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage.No one will lose Medicaid or CHIP coverage without first having an opportunity to renew their coverage or update their information.\nPennsylvanians can update their contact information, report changes in their personal circumstances, and check their renewal date:\nRenewals will be completed over 12 months at a persons usual time of renewal, and renewals due in April 2023 will be the first to be affected by the end of continuous coverage. If a person is found ineligible for coverage or does not complete their renewal on time, their Medicaid coverage will end. Pennsylvanians who are no longer eligible for Medicaid will be referred to other sources of affordable medical coverage, like CHIP and Pennie, so they have no lapse in quality, affordable health care.\nHealth coverage provides peace of mind, financial security, and access to preventative services to catch minor health issues before they become major problems, saidPennie Executive Director Devon Trolley. Through Pennie, nine out of 10 customers qualify for financial savings, and often for those no longer eligible Medicaid or CHIP, the coverage is low cost or potentially even no cost. We encourage anyone who needs health coverage to visit pennie.com to learn about their quality health plan options.\nPennie is Pennsylvanias official health insurance marketplace and the only place to get financial assistance to help lower the cost of high-quality coverage and care. Those who are no longer eligible for Medicaid coverage can apply for coverage throughpennie.com, and some individuals will have their information securely transferred from Medicaid or CHIP for an easier enrollment process.Customers can simplycall Pennie Customer Service at 1-844-844-8040 or find Pennie-certified pros atpennie.com/connect.\nBerks Community Health Center (BCHC) is a federally qualified health center established in 2012 to provide access to primary and specialty care for all patients, regardless of insurance coverage or ability to pay.
