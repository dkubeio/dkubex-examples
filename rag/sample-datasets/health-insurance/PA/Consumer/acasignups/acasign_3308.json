These numbers are tricky to hunt down, since they aren't tracked by the ACA exchanges. Most states either don't track them at all or don't make it easy for the public to locate, and it's even treated as a proprietary trade secret in a few states.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation gave a rough estimate of around 2.1 million people still being enrolled in GF/TR plans last year, but they never broke it out by state. Plus, of course, that was last summer; since no one can newly enter these types of policies, their numbers continue to gradually shrink year after year.\nIn Pennsylvania, Mark Farrah Associates estimated around 300,000 off-exchange individual market enrollees total...but they don't break out how many of them are enrolled in GF/TR plans. My suspicion, based on the limited data I do have from other large states like California and Florida, is that there's probably something like 60,000 combined GF/TR enrollees as of today in PA.\nHowever...assuming there aren't any major numbers missing below, it looks like the actual total in Pennsylvania was down to just 13,000 last year. If so, it' would be even lower today.\nFirst, according to this page on the Pennsylvania Insurance Dept. website:\nYou can find rate filings for products that either predate the Affordable Care Act (\"grandfathered\" products), or that have been granted a temporary period in which to transition into compliance with Affordable Care Act (\"transitional\" products), here.\nOK, that seems pretty clear: Grandfathered and Transitional policy rate filings are at that link...and I'm assuming this refers to all GR/TR policies still in effect, since no new ones are available, right?\nGeisinger Quality Options; Individual Grandfathered PPO Plan; Rate Filing\nView PA Bulletin Notice | View Filing Information\nGeisinger Quality Options; Individual Transitional PPO Plan; Rate Filing\nView PA Bulletin Notice | View Filing Information\nCapital Advantage Assurance Company (CABC-131157380); Individual MU PPO - Transitional Filing; Rate Filing\nView PA Bulletin Notice | View Filing Information \nHighmark Choice Company; Individual Grandfathered HMO Plan; Rate Filing\nView PA Bulletin Notice | View Filing Information\nHighmark Inc., d/b/a Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield; Individual Grandfathered Plans; Rate Filing\nView PA Bulletin Notice | View Filing Information\nUPMC Health Benefits, Inc.
