Today, Governor Wolf announced that over 700,000 Pennsylvanians have enrolled in HealthChoices, Pennsylvanias mandatory managed care Medicaid program, since expansion occurred two years ago. U.S. Census data shows that the commonwealths uninsured rate has dropped from 10.2 percent in 2010 to 6.4 percent in 2015.\nMedicaid expansion is working in the commonwealth. More people have access to health care, thousands of jobs were created, billions of dollars were infused into the economy, and hospitals have reduced uncompensated care, said Governor Tom Wolf. Additionally, we were able to provide access to critical drug and alcohol treatment to 124,170 newly eligible Pennsylvanians, which is helping to battle the opioid and heroin public health crisis.\nWe are now covering more than 700,000 people as a result of the Medicaid expansion Governor Wolf implemented and the uninsured rate is at an all-time low. Medicaid now provides essential care to approximately 21 percent of Pennsylvanians, said DHS Secretary Ted Dallas. The results of this report validate what we already knew  the significant impact this expansion has had on the commonwealth.\nAs of January 20, 2017, 706,281 Pennsylvanians from across every county are enrolled in Medicaid because of expansion. The commonwealth has seen an increase in providers to serve the additional recipients. There are 4,422 more physicians, 601 more dentists, and 444 more certified registered nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania now compared to prior to when Medicaid expansion took effect in April 2015.\nIt's important that the press release specifies that the 706,281 figure is duespecificallyto the expansion provision; this doesn't include \"woodworkers\".\nToday, Pennsylvania also released a report affirming the first year of Medicaid expansions positive impact on Medicaid enrollment, uninsured rates, the commonwealths budget, and the overall economy from January 2015 to December 2015. Utilization of health care services was also analyzed from April 2015 to March 2016.
