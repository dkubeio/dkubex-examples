In 4 of these states, I hadn't yet tallied theweightedaverage, so I temporarilyused the median increase for each. In the case of Pennsylvania, the range was from a 3.8%decreaseto a 33% increase, with a midpoint of around 14.6%.\nToday, however, I've actually plugged in the enrollment numbers for each sm. group carrier in Pennsylvania based on their 2017 rate request filings, and have come up with a weighted average of just 7.9%:\n\n"}
