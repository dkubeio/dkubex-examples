Rate Hike: 12.0% (reduced from 15.6%)\nThu, 10/15/2015 - 11:58am\nAt last!! It's been extremely frustrating trying to lock down the 2016 average premium hikes for Pennsylvania, especially because their Insurance Dept. website has actually beenverygood about postingevery requested rate changein an easy-to-read, comprehensive fashion.\nThe problem with PA's rate filings hasn't been on the percentage change side, it's on thecovered livesside. I was able to compile enrollment numbers for some carriers but not others...including First Priority, which was requesting a 29.5% rate hike. Without knowing whether they had a huge chunk of the market or not, posting the \"average\" rate hikes without including theirs was kind of meaningless, since it could potentially jack that average up or down dramatically.\nSo, I finally kind of gave up on it, figuring that even when theapprovedrates were posted, they probably still wouldn't include the number of covered lives for each insurance company.\nThankfully, it turns out I was wrong!\nJust today, the PA Dept. of Insurance published all of theirapprovedrate changes, and not only have they slashed the rates significantly for many carriers, they also included PDFs which clearly state exactly how many people would be impacted by them for every single company!\nHere's what it ends up looking like for the Keystone state:\n\nAs you can see, when all the numbers are plugged in, therequestedweighted average increase was about 15.6%, which is a bit higher than the current average but not by too much.\nHowever, with theapprovedrates entered, the overall, state-wide weighted average increases havebeen knocked down by 3.6 percentage points, to 12.0%.\nWhile this isn't great, it does fall right in the 12-14% average range which I've been seeing for the rest of the country.\n"}
