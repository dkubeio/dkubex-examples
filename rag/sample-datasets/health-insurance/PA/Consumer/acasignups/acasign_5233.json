He was defeated by Democrat Tom Wolf, who vowed to scrap the \"alternative\" version and simply expand Medicaid to residents below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, as the ACA had intended.\nThis transition was messy, but has now been completed...and is saving the people of Pennsylvania a boatload of money:\nDepartment of Human Services Sec. Ted Dallas Tuesday announced the end of the transition from Healthy PA to traditional Medicaid expansionknown as HealthChoices in Pennsylvaniaas the last of the expansion insurance plans took effect.\nAccording to Sec. Dallas, 440,000 Pennsylvanians are enrolled in Medicaid expansion insurance plans with the last group of enrollees coming out of Healthy PAs primary coverage options into Medicaid expansion.\nWith that last group of folks moving over, the Medicaid expansion is now complete, Sec. Dallas told reporters.\nHe added with the full transition now complete, Pennsylvania is eligible for more federal funding and will realize a savings of $626 million from people moving off of state-funded care to fully federally funded Medicaid expansion.\nNormally I'd be more geeked about the 440,000 enrollee update, but this is almost identical to my last PA Medicaid update (which listed it as 439,000 at the time), so the financial savings are the bigger story today.\n"}
