Tom Wolf announced he would scrap the Medicaid alternative briefly enacted by his predecessor and fully expand Medicaid, as permitted under the Affordable Care Act. The more than 100,000 people who had signed up for Republican Gov. Tom Corbetts Healthy PA plan are being transitioned into Medicaid coverage.\nThe expansion covers Pennsylvanians age 19 to 64 with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The state had estimated prior to the expansion that up to 600,000 people would be eligible for the coverage.\nThis news out of PA (Medicaid enrollment jumping up 189K over the past2.5 months) is one of the reasons why I'm quite confident that the net increase in Medicaid enrollment over October 2013nationallyis well over 13 million by now even though the last official report (through the end of March) had it at 12.2 million.\n\n"}
