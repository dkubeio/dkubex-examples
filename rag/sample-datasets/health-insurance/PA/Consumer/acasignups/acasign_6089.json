The number of applications from each county is not yet available, Gillis said.\nThe department is still processing applications but, she said, most of the new sign-ups are going into the Private Coverage Option, which is for people who are newly eligible because Healthy Pa.s income limits  133 percent of the federal poverty level, with a 5-percent income disregard  will be broader than Medicaids are.\nPA has around 600K residents eligible for the expansion program, so that's about 20% who have already signed up so far.\n"}
