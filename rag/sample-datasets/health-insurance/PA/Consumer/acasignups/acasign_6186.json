Open enrollment in the program has started and coverage will take effect Jan. 1. However Governor-elect Tom Wolf says he will scrap Healthy PA and opt in to Medicaid expansion.\nThe impending switch apparently has confused many low-income Pennsylvanians, and some are sitting on the sidelines rather than signing up for coverage.\nThe most important things is for people to enroll and to get their names on the list, said State Rep. Vincent Hughes (D- Philadelphia). If they are not on the list then they wont get the coverage.\"\nDespite the confusion, more than 27,000 households applied for coverage in the first week of enrollment, which began Dec. 1.\n"}
