On the other hand, it's not anything eyebrow-raising either; someone in a position to know has confirmed that at least 1,000 people hadenrolled in QHPs via at least one insurer in Pennsylvania as of 11/19.\nConsidering that PA enrolled over 300,000 people last year, and there are 10 companies participating on the exchange in the state anyway, this isn't a particularly shocking data point, so I'll leave it there, but I can at least add it to the spreadsheet for Pennsylvania, anyway.\n"}
