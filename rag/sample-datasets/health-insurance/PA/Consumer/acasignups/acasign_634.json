The IRA extends the enhancements to Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium subsidies originally created by the American Rescue Plan (ARP) which were set to expire at the end of the year. Thanks to this new law, Pennsylvanians will be able to receive these enhanced subsidies through 2025.\nAt the completion of Pennies most recent Open Enrollment, nearly 375,000 Pennsylvanians had signed up for coverage, with 90 percent qualifying for monthly premium subsidies worth $500 on average. If not for the IRA, Pennie customers would see their subsidies decrease next year by an estimated 20 percent, or by more than $1,200 a year on average.\nThe continuation of these subsidies means more Pennsylvanians will be able to afford coverage through Pennie next year. It means Pennsylvanians wont be forced to choose between accepting a wage increase and losing subsidy eligibility. And it means low-income Pennsylvanians who lose Medical Assistance at the end of the Public Health Emergency will be able to afford and access low-cost, and in some cases no-cost, plans through Pennie, noted Pennie Executive Director Zachary W. Sherman. We are thrilled these subsidies were included in the IRA and are grateful to Governor Wolf, Senator Casey and other members of the congressional delegation for their support and continued pursuit of affordable and accessible health coverage for Pennsylvanians.\nPennsylvanians can access these enhanced savings and 2022 health coverage through Pennie right now if they experience a Qualifying Life Event. In addition, uninsured Pennsylvanians and those considering their health coverage options for 2023 can sign-up during Pennies annual Open Enrollment Period which begins November 1stand runs through January 15th.\nThe expanded ARP subsidies played a critical role in ensuring affordable coverage for Pennsylvanians and in keeping Pennsylvanias uninsured rate at an all-time low, said Acting Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys. The determination and perseverance of the federal government to fight for expanded healthcare protections is more than appreciated and will go a long way in maintaining and expanding Pennsylvanians coverage gains.\nCustomers can visitpennie.comto preview their savings and coverage options, apply, and enroll in one easy location.
