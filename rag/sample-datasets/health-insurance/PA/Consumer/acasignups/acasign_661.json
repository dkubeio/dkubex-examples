Wolf: Commonwealth Continues to Expand Access to Health Care through New Qualifying Event for Low-Income Pennsylvanians\nWed, 07/20/2022 - 5:37pm\nOK, this is a bit odd...the press release is from March, butPennie.comdidn't post it on their site until today. Weird:\nGovernor Tom Wolf today announced that Pennsylvanias state-based health insurance marketplace, known as Pennie, has added a new qualifying life event to allow low-income Pennsylvanians the ability to enroll in health insurance throughout the year.\nSince taking office, a top priority of mine has been to expand access to quality, affordable health insurance to all Pennsylvanians, said Gov. Wolf. I strongly believe that access to health care is a fundamental right, but its also good for Pennsylvanias economy. This additional qualifying event will make health insurance accessible to some of Pennsylvanias most vulnerable citizens, providing them the security of knowing they can receive medical care without the astronomical costs associated with seeking care without health insurance.\nAdditionally, most Pennie customers are eligible to receive financial assistance to help pay for their health insurance. I urge all uninsured Pennsylvanians to visitpennie.comto access the health care they deserve.\nThis new qualifying life event will allow Pennsylvanians with an annual household income equal to or below 150% of the federal poverty level to shop and enroll in health insurance through Pennie. Financial assistance is also available for Pennsylvanians, as nearly 90 percent of the almost 375,000 Pennie customers receive. The average financial assistance is $500 per month. Pennsylvanians enrolling during 2022 can also benefit from the increased subsidies provided by the American Rescue Plan, which has changed the affordability of health coverage across the nation.\nHousehold / Family Size: Annual Income\nOne of Pennies overarching goals is to reduce barriers and inequities experienced by vulnerable populations, said Pennies Executive Director Zachary Sherman. This new opportunity, making it easier for low-income Pennsylvanians to stay and get covered, is a step in the right direction. Thanks to initiatives like these and the savings from the American Rescue Plan, coverage through Pennie has never been more within reach for so many Pennsylvanians. If you or your family just missed the limit to qualify for Medical Assistance, come topennie.comand enroll in health coverage today.\nTo receive this new qualifying life event through Pennie, new customers will need to visit pennie.com, click Get Covered and submit an application. If the customer meets the income qualifications, a Special Enrollment Period will automatically open.
