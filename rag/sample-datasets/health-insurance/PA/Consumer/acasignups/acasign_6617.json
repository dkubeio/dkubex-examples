Tom Corbett would be the ninth Republican governor to sign on.\nAccording to the CMS Dept, however, the actual number eligible in Pennsylvania could top 500,000:\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: CMS Media Relations\nAugust 28, 2014\n(202) 690-6145 or press@cms.hhs.gov\nCMS Statement on Approval of Medicaid Expansion in Pennsylvania\nCMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner issued the following statement today after Pennsylvania became the 28th state, including the District of Columbia, to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\nWith the agreements announced today, Pennsylvania will become the 28th state, including the District of Columbia, to adopt the Affordable Care Acts Medicaid expansion, helping approximately 500,000 Pennsylvanians get the health care coverage they need, said Administrator Tavenner. Like we are doing in Pennsylvania, HHS and CMS are committed to supporting state flexibility and working with states on innovative solutions that work within the confines of the law to expand Medicaid to low-income individuals. But, unfortunately, millions of Americans are still without Medicaid coverage because their state has yet to act.\nFast Facts on Healthy Pennsylvania\nThe expansion is paid for with 100 percent federal funds through 2016. Federal funding rates gradually decline beginning in 2017, but never fall below 90 percent of costs.\nI'm not sure what accounts for the 200K difference, but I'd imagine that 300K is the number expected to enroll in the first year of the program, with up to 500,000 eventually enrolling. However, based on the experience in other states so far, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they hit the 500K number all within the first year anyway.\n"}
