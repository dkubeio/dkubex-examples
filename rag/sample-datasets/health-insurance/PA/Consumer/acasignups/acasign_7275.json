She says more than 90,000 people in the region, across all ages, have joined plans since open enrollment started.\nI see no reason why that 47% would have changed since late December, so Independence's off-exchange tally should be up to around42,570 by now.\n(Oh, and before you ask, I already checked to see if Independence Blue Cross is the same as Highmark, which I've already reported off-exchange numbers for; according to one of my contributors, \"They are not the same company. Highmark just holds the \"Shield\" in the region. Highmark only sells in western and central PA. Also, a Highmark and IBC merger was denied/withdrawn in 2009.\"\nFair enough. 42.5K more it is.\n"}
