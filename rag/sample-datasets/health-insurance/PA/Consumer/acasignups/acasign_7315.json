Virginia & Delaware!\nThu, 03/13/2014 - 1:23pm\nA beautiful find by new contributor Uncle Toby: Highmark Inc., a major insurer which serves Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware, just did exactlywhat I've been wanting every insurer to do: They officiallyannounced not just their off-exchange enrollments, but specified the exact date that these run throughandthe fact that they're all 100% ACA compliant.\nAs a bonus, they've included specific state-by-state breakdowns as well as a comparison against theiron-exchangeenrollments. 32% of PA's, 27% of WV's and 29% of Delaware's QHP enrollees to date have been off-exchange.This proves exactly what I've been saying: There are absolutely several million (at a minimum) direct QHPs out there which simply haven't been documented publicly yet.\nAll told, this adds 41,117 to the total Off-Exchange tally:\nPITTSBURGH (March 11, 2014)  Today, Highmark Inc. shared enrollment numbers that showed individuals continue to choose the health insurer for their coverage both on and off the federal marketplace in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware.\nHighmark's current total enrollment* for individuals who have purchased Affordable Care Act-compliant plans both on the federal marketplace exchange and through Highmark directly:\nPennsylvania: 108,390 total with 74,006 on-exchange and 34,384 off-exchange\nWest Virginia: 14,980 total with 10,970 on-exchange and 4,010 off-exchange\nDelaware: 9,244 total with 6,521 on-exchange and 2,723 off-exchange\nThrough both on- and off-exchange purchases, Highmark is seeing a significant percentage of new members, which are likely those who were previously uninsured or had insurance with a competitor.\nPennsylvania: 53 percent new members\nWest Virginia: 66 percent new members\nDelaware: 70 percent new members\n\"As the enrollment period nears its end, we're happy to see that consumers are continuing to choose Highmark products on and off the exchange,\" said Deborah Rice Johnson, president of Highmark Health Plan. \"Highmark is committed to providing individuals with affordable health care options, and we look forward to serving our new customers.\"\nHighmark also continues to see a high percentage of enrollment in its Community Blue plans in Pennsylvania. Of all of the individual plans sold by Highmark, 78 percent have been Community Blue plans.\n...*Enrollment numbers as of March 10, 2014 are of those who have been loaded to Highmark's system through completed enrollments (834s that have been verified and processed by Highmark). These enrolled members may have not yet paid their first month's premium, therefore have not completed the entire enrollment process.\nEven better: By providing their total enrollments, this helps give a sense of the larger off-exchange numbers in these 3 states (the numbers in the PR are through 3/10 instead of 3/01, but theratiosshould be about the same since then, which is my focus here:\n"}
