New Jersey lawmakers passed a similar bill in 2021.\nAlthough Pennsylvanias legislation has not advanced, Pennies board of directors noted that the legal authority already exists for Pennie and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue to implement an easy enrollment program. As of August 2021, the process of implementing the program was well underway, and its expected to be in use by early 2022 (ie, utilizing the 2021 tax returns that residents file in 2022).\nPennsylvanias easy enrollment program will add a question to the state tax return where filers can indicate if anyone in their household is uninsured. If so, the filer can opt to give the department of revenue permission to communicate their relevant information to Pennie, and that data transfer will happen in three batches during the tax filing season, starting in March. Once the exchange receives the relevant information from the department of revenue, the exchange will then determine whether anyone in the household is eligible for subsidized private coverage or coverage under Medicaid or CHIP. If so, the exchange will work to help the person enroll in coverage. This will include the provision of a 60-day special enrollment period for people who are determined eligible for a subsidized private plan through Pennie.\nSure enough, the program is already live on the Pennie.com website:\nWhat is the Path to Pennie program?\nPath to Pennie is a new program this tax season created to connect uninsured Pennsylvanians with health coverage offered through Pennie, Pennsylvanias health insurance marketplace. As uninsured tax filers complete their Pennsylvania state income tax return, they will have a chance to indicate whether they would like to receive more information about enrolling in health coverage available through Pennie. Interested tax filers will complete Tax Form REV-1882, Health Insurance Coverage Information Request. \nWho should fill out the REV-1882 form when doing their taxes? \nAll medically uninsured Pennsylvanians who are interested in learning more about their health coverage options should fill out Form REV-1882. The tax filer should fill out the form for themselves, their spouse, and/or any dependents who do not have health insurance coverage. Filling out the form is not the same as applying for health coverage: It will only be used for Pennie to send the tax filer a postal mail Notice with information on the steps one can take to apply for, shop, and enroll in health insurance coverage.\nWhat happens when a tax filer checks the box?\nA free online Pennie account will be created on behalf of the tax filer. They will also then receive a postal mail Notice from Pennie. The Notice will let the receiver know if they appear eligible to enroll in Pennie and will include a unique access code for them to claim their Pennie online account. The tax filer will also see the estimated dollar amount of financial assistance they appear eligible to receive from Pennie thanks to the information shared by the Department of Revenue. There will be a section in the Notice with information on how to enroll in coverage through pennie.com or by phone.\n(there's more details at the link, but you get the idea)\nThe state exchange also included some details on the program in their most recent board of directors meeting slide deck:\nLanded on Path to Pennie as the official program name. Easy Enrollment is what the program is called in Maryland and has been temporarily used while we worked to create our own name. Path to Pennie appropriately captures the programs purpose and ensures the Department of Revenues role is recognized (myPath is the name of DORs online tax filing hub).\n"}
