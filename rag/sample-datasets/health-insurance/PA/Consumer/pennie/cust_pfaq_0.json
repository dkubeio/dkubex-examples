You should \nimmediately\n end Pennie coverage for anyone in your household who is enrolled in the Medicaid plan and is also using premium tax credits through Pennie.\nIf your Medicaid plan DOESN'T qualify as minimum essential coverage you \nare\n eligible for \npremium tax credits\n and other financial assistance through Pennie, if you qualify based on your income and other criteria."}
