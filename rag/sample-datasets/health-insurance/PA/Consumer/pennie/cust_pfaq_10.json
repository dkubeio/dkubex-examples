It is recommended that you cancel your plan through Pennie if you are receiving \nMedicaid or CHIP\n coverage that counts as minimum essential coverage (MEC) to ensure that you will not be charged your monthly premium.\nIf you're canceling coverage before the start date of your plan through Pennie, you won't be charged a \npremium\n at all. However, if you decide to terminate your coverage through Pennie after it has started, the coverage will end at the end of the month you submit your termination request and you'll be responsible for your monthly premium during the month you decide to terminate.\nNote: Make sure to update your Pennie application within 30 days whenever your circumstances change, to ensure youre receiving the right amount of financial assistance so you wont have to pay it back at tax time."}
