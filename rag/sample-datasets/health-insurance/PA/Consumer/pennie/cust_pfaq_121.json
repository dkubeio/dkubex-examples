What should I do?\n          \n        \nPennie was created to help connect Pennsylvanians to the health insurance coverage that best meets their needs and circumstances, regardless of what types of coverage they qualify for or how they apply. With Pennie, this connected approach will lead you to the optimal solution. You can apply whether or not you qualify for \nMedicaid (Medical Assistance)\n with one of two options:\nOption One:\n Pennsylvanians who are interested in applying for healthcare coverage but are not sure if they qualify can go to \nwww.COMPASS.state.pa.us\n and complete a quick screening by clicking on the link, DO I QUALIFY on the COMPASS home page. The COMPASS screening will tell individuals which program they may qualify for based on their responses to the screening questions. If an individual is screened as potentially eligible for healthcare insurance coverage through Pennie and not Medicaid, they will be directed to apply directly through the www.pennie.com link on the screening results page.\nRegardless of the results of the screening, individuals may choose to apply for healthcare coverage through the COMPASS website. If the individual is determined ineligible for Medicaid (called Medical Assistance in PA), their information will be transferred to either Pennie or the \nChildrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP)\n, which covers uninsured children under 19. There are no income limits for CHIP.\n\nOption Two:\n Should you prefer to start off with Pennie because you are claiming your account that was transferred (with an access code) from Healthcare.gov and are questioning, based on a change in circumstances, that you might now be eligible for Medicaid (Medical Assistance), you can apply for health insurance coverage at \nwww.pennie.com\n and click the yellow box Get Covered at the top of the Pennie home page.\nIndividuals applying for healthcare coverage through Pennie who are assessed as potentially eligible for Medical Assistance or CHIP by Pennie will have their application transferred to the Department of Human Services for a Medical Assistance or CHIP eligibility determination.\nIf you need help setting up your Pennie account or the application process, you can call Pennie at 1-844-844-8040.\nIf you have questions about the COMPASS screening process or Medicaid (Medical Assistance) in general, you can call the Statewide Customer Service Center at 1-877-395-8930 to get more information.Residents of Philadelphia should call 1-215-560-7226.\nNo matter how you choose to apply, Pennie will work with you to find the best, most affordable and comprehensive health coverage."}
