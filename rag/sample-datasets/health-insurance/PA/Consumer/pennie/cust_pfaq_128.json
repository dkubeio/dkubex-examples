This means you'll compare two figures:\n\n\nThe amount of premium tax credit you used in advance during theyear to lower your monthly premium payment; and\n\n\n\n\nThe total amount of premium tax credits you actually qualified for based on your total income for the year.\n\n\nAny difference between the two figures will affect your refund or amount of tax owed.\nIn addition, if you personally elected to use less premium tax credit during the plan year than what you were eligible for, then reconciliation is the process that connects you with those credits during tax season. If you reported your total income correctly to Pennie throughout the plan year, you are less likely to have any issues related to reconciling.\nPennie will mail or send all forms for reconciling by January 31st  you will need Form 1095-Awhen you fill out your 2022 taxes.
