You are eligible for these benefits, regardless of whether your pregnancy began before your coverage started. Each health plan sold through Pennie must have a Summary of Benefits and Coverage, which includes a description of how the plan covers the cost of childbirth.\n\nPlease note that the birth of a child is a \nQualifying Life Event (QLE)\n, which triggers a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). During a SEP, existing customers may add or drop dependents and/or change plans, and new customers may enroll for the first time. Please refer to \nthis FAQ\n for additional information on reporting QLEs and submitting enrollment changes.\n\nMaternity care and childbirth are also covered by Medicaid (Medical Assistance or MA) for individuals below certain income levels. Once the baby is born, they may be eligible for \nMedicaid or CHIP.\n You can apply for Medicaid or CHIP at any time during the year. \nSee if you qualify for Medicaid\n."}
