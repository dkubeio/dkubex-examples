You may be eligible for lower costs on monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs based on your household income.\n\n\nIf your annual income is between 100% and 400% of the \nfederal poverty level\n (FPL):\n You may qualify for premium tax credits and/or cost sharing reductions (CSR) to lower the cost of health coverage and care.\n\n\nIf your annual household income is above 400% FPL: \nYou may still qualify for premium tax credits that reduce the cost of your health coverage in 2022.\n\n\nIf your annual household income is below 100% FPL:\n If youre not otherwise eligible for Medicaid based on your immigration status you may qualify for premium tax credits and other savings through Pennie, if you meet all other eligibility requirements.\n\n\nIf your annual income is between 100% and 400% of the \nfederal poverty level\n (FPL):\nIf your annual household income is above 400% FPL: \nIf your annual household income is below 100% FPL:\nImmigrants and Medicaid & CHIP\n\nImmigrants who are qualified non-citizens are generally eligible for coverage through Medicaid (Medical Assistance or MA) and the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP), if you meet Pennsylvania Medicaid requirements. \nIn order to qualify for Medicaid and CHIP coverage, many qualified non-citizens (such as many Lawfully Permanent Residents or green card holders) have a 5-year waiting period, also known as the 5-year bar. This means they must wait 5 years after receiving \"qualified\" immigration status before they are eligible for Medicaid and CHIP coverage. However, there are exceptions. In Pennsylvania, children aged 18 or younger, pregnant women, refugees, asylees, or lawful permanent residents who used to be refugees or asylees dont have to wait 5 years to qualify for MA or CHIP\nThe term qualified non-citizen includes:\n\n\nLawful Permanent Residents (LPR/Green Card Holder)\n\n\nAsylees\n\n\nRefugees\n\n\nCuban/Haitian entrants\n\n\nParoled into the U.S. for at least one year\n\n\nConditional entrant granted before 1980\n\n\nBattered non-citizens, spouses, children, or parents\n\n\nVictims of trafficking and his or her spouse, child, sibling, or parent or individuals with a pending application for a victim of trafficking visa\n\n\nGranted withholding of deportation\n\n\nMember of a federally recognized Indian tribe or American Indian born in Canada\n\n\nCitizens of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau who are living in one of the U.S. states or territories (referred to as Compact of Free Association or COFA migrants)\n\n\nMedicaid & CHIP coverage for lawfully residing children and pregnant women\n\nIn Pennsylvania lawfully residing children and pregnant women can enroll in Medicaid and CHIP without a five-year waiting period. A child or pregnant woman is \"lawfully residing\" if theyre \"lawfully present\" and otherwise eligible for Medicaid or CHIP in the Commonwealth. Learn how someone is defined as \nlawfully present\n.\n\nMedicaid, CHIP, Pennie and Public Charge:\n\nOn March 11, 2021, President Biden formally rescinded the public charge rule, so it is not in effect. Applying for, and/or enrolling, in health coverage through Medicaid, CHIP, or Pennie will not make someone a public charge or affect their ability to become a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) or U.S. citizen in the future.\nRemember: \nPennie will only collect information \nabout \nimmigration status \nfor the explicit purpose of \ndetermining eligibility for \nhealth \ncoverage\n, and not for any other purpose.\nRemember:"}
