You're considered self-employed if you have a business that takes in income but doesn't have any employees other than yourself, a spouse, or a family member.\nMake sure to apply and enroll in coverage through Pennie during Open Enrollment, which takes place\n November 1, 2021  January 15, 2022\n: By submitting a Pennie application, youll find out if you qualify for:\n\n\nFinancial assistance to help pay for health coverage and care. This will be based on your income and household size.\n\n\nFree or low-cost coverage through Medicaid (Medical Assistance or MA). If you have children, you'll find out if they qualify for coverage through \nMedicaid or CHIP.\n\n\nSelf-employment income and Pennie savings:\n\n\nWhen you fill out a Pennie application, you'll have to estimate your net self-employment income. Eligibility for financial assistance is based on your \nestimated net income for the year you're getting coverage, not last year's income.\n\n\nIf you leave a job for any reason and lose job-based insurance\n: You can buy an insurance plan using a Special Enrollment Period. You have\n 60 days\n from when the insurance ends to enroll.\n\n\nIf you have income that's hard to predict\n: You can apply with your best estimate of what you expect to make for the year. Your savings will be based on that estimate. When your income changes, you can update your application to adjust your coverage and savings.\n\n\nYou can choose from several categories of coverage from Pennie, from plans with low premiums that mainly protect you in worst-case scenarios to plans where you'll pay more each month but less out-of-pocket when you access healthcare services.\n\n\nIf you're under 30 or have a hardship exemption, you can pick a Catastrophic health plan - an inexpensive way to protect yourself from worst-case scenarios."}
