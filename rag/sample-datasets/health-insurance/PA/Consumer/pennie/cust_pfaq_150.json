For the purposes of eligibility for coverage through Pennie, \"incarcerated\" means serving a term in prison or jail.\nIncarceration doesn't include being on probation, parole, or home confinement.\nYou're not considered incarcerated if you're in jail or prison but haven't been convicted of a crime.\nAfter you're released, you have a 60-day Special Enrollment Period to sign up for health coverage through Pennie even if it is outside of the annual Open Enrollment Period.\nIf you're in jail or prison but haven't been convicted of a crime, you can create an account or log in to use Pennie to buy a private health insurance plan."}
