The households eligibility for financial assistance will be redetermined upon removal of the deceased individual from the household. Any changes to financial assistance will be automatically applied to the enrolled family members coverage.\nWe recommend that the family log back into their Pennie account to review their application to update any other information that may have changed, including tax filing status, financial information, address, etc. Family members also may qualify for a special enrollment period (SEP) to change their health coverage but only if the change is made within 60 days of the date of death of the family member."}
