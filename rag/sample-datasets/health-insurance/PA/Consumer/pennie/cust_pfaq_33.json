When can I enroll?\n          \n        \nPennie is there for you when the unexpected happens!\nIf the loss of your job occurred/occurs during Pennie open enrollment, which begins on November 1, 2020 and ends January 15\nth\n, you can apply for coverage right away. You can apply for health coverage outside of the open enrollment window with Pennie because the loss of job-based coverage is considered a qualifying life event that enables you to enroll through a special enrollment period as long as you do so within 60 days of losing your coverage. Visit \npennie.com\n and click on the yellow box labeled Get Covered.\nIf you need help applying, you can call Pennie Customer Service at 1-844-844-8040 (TTY: 711) to speak with a Pennie Customer Service Representative for guidance and direction.\nPennsylvanians who lost their job and job-based healthcare coverage can also apply for Medical Assistance online through \nwww.COMPASS.state.pa.us\n. The individual will be reviewed for Medical Assistance from the date their application was submitted through COMPASS. If the individual is determined ineligible for \nMedical Assistance\n, their information will be transferred to Pennie or to \nCHIP\n, which covers uninsured children under 19.\nNo matter if you apply through Pennie or COMPASS, we are committed to ensuring your application gets to the right place so you can enroll in the health coverage that meets the needs of you and your family."}
