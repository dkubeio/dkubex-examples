You can enroll your child in \nCHIP,\n if they otherwise qualify, any time throughout the year.\nPennie makes it easy for you and your family to understand your coverage options regardless of what plans you qualify for. Once you submit a Pennie application and Pennie believes your child likely qualifies for free or low-cost CHIP coverage, their application information will be sent to the Department of Human Services (DHS) to confirm. Pennie does not automatically send a child that is eligible for full-cost CHIP directly over to DHS to ensure that you can see their coverage options through Pennie."}
