Will I still receive financial assistance through the new state program? \n          \n        \nPennie uses the same standards to determine your ability to receive financial assistance to help pay for the cost of health coverage and care as Healthcare.gov. Your ability to receive \nAdvanced Premium Tax Credits (APTC)\n to lower the cost of your premium, or \nCost-sharing Reductions\n to lower the cost of using healthcare services, will not change because of the transition from Healthcare.gov to Pennie."}
