Does that mean I have to go complete another application through COMPASS to get Medical Assistance? \n          \n        \nThats where Pennie makes it easy! Pennie applicants who receive a notice that they are potentially eligible for Medicaid (called Medical Assistance in PA) do \nNOT\n need to submit another application through COMPASS. Their initial application submitted through Pennie will be transferred to the Department of Human Services for a Medical Assistance eligibility determination. The local County Assistance Office will review their application and may request additional verification from the individual if necessary to make a final eligibility determination.\nIf you have questions about the COMPASS screening process or Medicaid (Medical Assistance) in general, you can call the Statewide Customer Service Center at 1-877-395-8930 to get more information. Residents of Philadelphia should call 1-215-560-7226.\nA Pennie Customer Service Representative can help with guidance and direction as well as application support by calling 1-844-844-8040.
