Thresholds are updated annually.\nIf you have an offer of job-based coverage through a spouse or parent it is important that you include the premium information of the lowest cost family coverage (that is, the cost to cover the employee+spouse+any tax dependents) that meets minimum value standards to see if you are eligible for financial assistance.\n(Note: The policies governing eligibility for financial assistance are set by the federal government, and not the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or Pennie\n).\nOther Resources:\n\n\nMy family is eligible for job-based coverage but Im not sure how to answer the questions about my employers health coverage in the Employee Coverage Detail section of the application."}
