You can submit your Pennie application even if you do not have a Social Security Number (SSN). Some applicants, including those who are lawfully present and/or non-citizens, could be lawfully present and not have an SSN. In these cases, the SSN field should be left blank.Please do not enter an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) in this field.You will then be asked to verify that you have an eligible immigration status by indicating the document you can provide and including specific information from that document.\nNOTE: Anyone applying for coverage, or adults included on the Pennie application but not applying for coverage, are required to provide an SSN if they have one. All household members are encouraged to provide an SSN if they have one to prevent any delays in the eligibility determination and enrollment process."}
