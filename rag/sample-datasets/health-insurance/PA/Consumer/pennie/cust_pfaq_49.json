Your insurer may terminate your coverage if you fail to pay your premium. The timeline for termination varies depending on whether you receive\nadvance premium tax credits (APTC).\n\n\n\nIf you receive APTC, you are eligible for a 3-month grace period. If you do not make a complete payment by the end of the grace period, your last day of coverage will be retroactively applied to the last day of the first month of the 3-month grace period.\n\n\n\nIf you do not receive APTC, you are eligible for a 1-month grace period, based on Pennsylvania regulations. If you do not make payment by the end of the grace period, your last day of coverage will be the last day of the 1-month grace period.\n\n\n\nGrace periods do not apply to your first month's payment (Binder Payment). You must\npay\nthe first months premium\n(\"binder payment\") with your insurance company to complete the enrollment process. If you dont make your binder payment, your policy will not take effect and you will not be enrolled in coverage.\n\n\n\nThe grace period starts the first month you fail to pay, even if you make payments for the following months. You have the right to appeal your termination for non-payment if you believe your coverage was wrongly terminated. Please note that if you have been terminated for non-payment you will not be able to re-enroll in coverage until the next Open Enrollment period, unless you experience a qualifying life event.\n\n\n\nPlease reference\nthis FAQ\nfor information on how to pay your premium.\n\nAlso see:\nBinder Payments\nMaking your first and future premium payment\nHow long do I have to make my first premium payment?"}
