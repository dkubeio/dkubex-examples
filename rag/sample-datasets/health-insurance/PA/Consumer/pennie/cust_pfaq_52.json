Please answer the questions accurately to ensure that you are able to enroll in the right coverage.\nIf you have one or more of these conditions, you are considered to be an individual with a disability for the purposes of your Pennie application:\n\n\nYou're blind, deaf, or hard of hearing.\n\n\nYou receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI).\n\n\nYou have a physical, cognitive, intellectual, or mental health condition, which causes one or more of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty doing errands, like visiting a doctor's office or shopping.\n\n\nSerious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.\n\n\nDifficulty walking or climbing stairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor children, these conditions are considered disabilities:\n\n\nLimited ability to do the things most children of the same age can do.\n\n\nRequire or use more health care than is usual for most children of the same age.\n\n\nReceive special education services or services under a Section 504 plan.\n\n\nIf you indicate on your Pennie application that you are disabled, Pennie will send your application to the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services to determine whether you are eligible for Medicaid based on your disability. If you dont qualify for Medicaid based on your disability, you may still be eligible based on your income.\nIf the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania determines that you dont have a qualifying disability and dont qualify for Medicaid based on your income, you can still buy health coverage through Pennie and may qualify for financial assistance. Plans cant deny you coverage or charge you more because of a disability or \npre-existing condition\n."}
