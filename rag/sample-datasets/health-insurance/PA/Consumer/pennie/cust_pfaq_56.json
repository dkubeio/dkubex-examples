What are our options?\n          \n        \nIn Pennsylvania, there are many ways to enroll your newborn in quality coverage. It is easy to add a newborn to your current marketplace plan through Pennie. The addition of a new baby qualifies you for a \nspecial enrollment period\n outside of the annual open enrollment period as long as you update your application and enroll the newborn in coverage within 60 days of birth. You can add your newborn to your existing coverage or their own coverage within your application. You and your newborn may also qualify for financial assistance to lower the cost of coverage.\nYou can also apply for coverage through the \nChildrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or Medical Assistance\n, if they qualify, at any time throughout the year. These programs offer plans specifically tailored for children to ensure they can grow up healthy and happy!"}
