Why were my subsidies changed or removed? \n          \n        \nYour monthly subsidies may change (increase or decrease) or be removed altogether from your policy due to newly reported information on your Pennie application. Changes in your APTC amount may happen as a result of reported changes to your::\n\n\nIncome,\n\n\nFamily size,\n\n\nTax filing status\n\n\nFor example, if your household income increases, you may be eligible for less monthly APTC, and your monthly premium may increase. If your annual income decreases, you may be eligible for more APTC, and your premium may decrease.\nIn addition, if Pennie finds that you are eligible for affordable Minimum Essential Coverage outside of Pennie, you will be determined ineligible for federal subsidies, and your APTC will be removed. For example, if you are eligible for Medicaid, you cannot receive federal subsidies on Pennie coverage. In addition, if you report that you have an offer of affordable health coverage through your employer, you will be found ineligible for federal subsidies on your Pennie account. For a more detailed summary on what might be impacting your subsides, you can reach out to a Pennie Customer Service at 1-844-844-8040."}
