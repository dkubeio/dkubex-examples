Evan has a spouse and two children. Evans employer offers three health plans, only two of which are minimum value (see table below). They will use the cost of the lowest cost minimum value plan (Plan #A2) to determine if the job-based coverage is affordable. When completing the application, they will enter the employee only cost ($200 per month for Plan #A2) to determine if the job-based coverage is affordable for Evan. For Evans family members, they will enter the family cost ($600 per month for Plan #A2) to determine if the job-based coverage is affordable for Evans spouse and children. The reason they use family cost is that is the level of coverage that would cover Evan and all of Evans eligible tax dependents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans Job-Based Coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan #A1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan #A2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan #A3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs plan minimum value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee cost (monthly):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Employee Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 323\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Employee + Spouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 450\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 723\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Employee + Child(ren)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 350\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 525\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Family\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 550\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ 825\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Evans annual household income is $60,000, the job-based coverage would be affordable for Evan but unaffordable for Evans spouse and children.
