The customer sought care at an in-network facility but since theycouldntchoose their provider,theymightbe subject to a surprise medical billreflecting the cost of the out-of-network specialist.With implementation of the No Surprises Act,the customer is betterprotectedfrom potentially high out-of-network charges from those providers.\n\nNo Surprises Act\nSurprise medical billscanposesignificantfinancial burdens onconsumerswhen health plans deny out-of-network claims or apply higher out-of-network cost sharing; consumers also face balance billing from out-of-network providers that have not contracted to accept discounted payment rates from the health planthat in-network providers accept.\n\nMore information can be found at the\nwebsite\nfor the United States Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nHow does the No Surprises Act protect consumers from surprise medical bills?\n\nThe Act ensures that customers wont be charged more than thein-network cost sharingfor inadvertentlyreceivingcare from an out-of-network provider they didnt choose.
