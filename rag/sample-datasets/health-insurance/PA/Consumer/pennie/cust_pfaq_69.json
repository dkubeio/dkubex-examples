If you are offered a job-based plan from your employer, and that plan meets this standard, you wont be eligible for a premium tax credit if you buy a Marketplace insurance plan instead.\nA health plan meets the minimum value standard if both of these apply:\n\n\nIts designed to pay at least 60% of the total cost of medical services for a standard population\n\n\nIts benefits include substantial coverage of physician and inpatient hospital services\n\n\nEmployees can learn whether their health plan meets minimum value by requesting a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) from their employer. You can also ask them to fill out the \nEmployer Coverage Tool (PDF)\n."}
