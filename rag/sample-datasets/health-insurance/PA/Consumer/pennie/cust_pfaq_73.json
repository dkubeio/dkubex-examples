While there are many similarities to the federal program, Pennie brings health coverage closer to home, and is focused solely on improving access to health coverage for Pennsylvanians.\nPennie is also driven to provide a superior customer service experience across the Commonwealth. With Pennie, Pennsylvanians have access to a variety of resources to help them understand how to apply, shop, and enroll in coverage, including access to people who can help them right in their community. Pennie is custom built by Pennsylvanians for Pennsylvania to meet the states health coverage needs."}
