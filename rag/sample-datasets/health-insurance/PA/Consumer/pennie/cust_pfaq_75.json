The IRS does this by comparing the annual ratio of insurance premium growth against overall national income growth.\n\nIn 2019, the affordability threshold rate was 9.78% of income. In 2021, it was 9.83% of income. Years in which insurance premium rates rise more than national income growth will see a rise in the affordability threshold rate."}
