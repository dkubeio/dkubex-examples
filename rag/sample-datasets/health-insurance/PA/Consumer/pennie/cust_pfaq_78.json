The amount you must pay back to the IRS is based on your final incomethe lower your income, the lower the amount of the payback. When you complete Form 8962, you will find out if a maximum payback amount applies to you. If you are entitled to a larger tax credit than you received in advance, you will receive the full amount as part of your refund.\n\nThe maximum payback amounts help protect you from incorrect estimates, changing circumstances and mistakes. If you do find that you owe money this year, Pennie can work with you now to help avoid this happening again next year.
