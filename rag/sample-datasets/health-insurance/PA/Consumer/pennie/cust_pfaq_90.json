Once youre eligible for Medicare, youll have an Initial Enrollment Period to sign up for Medicare. For most people, the Initial Enrollment Period starts 3 months before their 65th birthday and ends 3 months after their 65th birthday. \nIf you are enrolled in coverage through Pennie, you can keep it until your Medicare coverage starts. However, you will want to terminate your Pennie coverage just before your Medicare coverage begins to avoid paying full price for a plan through Pennie.\nIMPORTANT: Your Pennie coverage does NOT automatically terminate when your Medicare coverage begins. \nTo ensure a smooth transition from Pennie to Medicare and to prevent a gap in coverage, Pennie encourages plan termination through Pennie in advance of your Medicare start date.\nFor example, if you know your Medicare is going to start on September 1, you can terminate your plan through Pennie at any time during the 3 months prior to September 1, ideally, with an end date of August 31.\nYou can sequence and manage the transition termination effective date by terminating your Pennie plan online through your Pennie account or by calling Pennie Customer Service at 1-844-844-8040.\nFor more information about enrolling in Medicare:\nwww.Medicare.gov\nPA MEDI - Medicare Counseling\nFor more information:\nHow do I cancel my plan through Pennie?\n  pennie help"}
