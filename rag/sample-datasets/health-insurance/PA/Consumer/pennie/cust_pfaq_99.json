Am I eligible for coverage through Pennie? \nYes. An immigrant who has been granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) by USCIS is considered to be lawfully present, and therefore, eligible for coverage through Pennie. On the Pennie application, you will need to document your visa status as having Temporary Protected Status. On the section of the Pennie application that asks for visa and immigration information, you will need to fill out your information completely. A list of documents that an immigrant may use to verify their immigration status with Pennie is available here (these documents are also used to verify Temporary Protected Status): \nDocuments to confirm your immigration status  pennie help\n\nI am an immigrant who has applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Am I eligible for coverage through Pennie?\nYes. An immigrant who has applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) with USCIS is considered to be lawfully present, and therefore, eligible for Pennie coverage. Additionally, if you have applied for TPS, but have not yet received a determination from USCIS on your TPS application, you are still eligible for Pennie coverage. Pennie considers having an open TPS application with USCIS to be an eligible immigration status for Pennie coverage, as the time length on receiving a determination varies and can be lengthy. \n\nIf my application for Temporary Protected Status is denied by USCIS, will I be eligible to enroll in Pennie?\nIf your application for TPS is ultimately denied by USCIS, this will affect your eligibility for Pennie coverage. A person who does not have a qualifying immigration status is not eligible to enroll in or maintain coverage through Pennie. If you are not granted TPS, and do not have another qualifying immigration status, you would become ineligible for coverage through Pennie. Once a determination has been made by USCIS on your application for TPS, you should contact Pennie on your determination or update your Pennie account online.\n\nWhich countries are currently designated for Temporary Protected Status?\nThe list of countries designated for Temporary Protected Status is maintained by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. As of July 2022, the current list of countries designated for TPS includes:\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n\n\nBurma (Myanmar)\n\n\nCameroon\n\n\nEl Salvador\n\n\nHaiti\n\n\nHonduras\n\n\nNepal\n\n\nNicaragua\n\n\nSomalia\n\n\nSudan\n\n\nSouth Sudan\n\n\nSyria\n\n\nUkraine\n\n\nVenezuela\n\n\nYemen\n\n\nFor the most-updated list of countries designated for TPS, visit: \nTemporary Protected Status | USCIS\n\nFor more information on TPS, visit the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services webpage on the topic: \nTemporary Protected Status | USCIS"}
