Insurance companies must offer same-sex spouses the same coverage it offers to opposite-sex spouses.\nIn most cases, a married couple has to file a joint federal tax return to be eligible for premium tax credits and other savings on a Pennie plan.\nWhen you apply for coverage through Pennie, you'll be asked if you're married. If you and your spouse plan to file a joint federal tax return, select yes.\nYou can access more information about the tax-filing status for same-sex spouses, \nhere\n."}
