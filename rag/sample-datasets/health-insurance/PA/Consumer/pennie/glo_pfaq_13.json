This is the best way to find out if you qualify for a private health plan with premium tax credits and other financial assistance based on your income.\nCall the Pennie Contact Center if you need assistance in creating your Pennie account and filling out your enrollment application by calling 1-844-844-8040.\nPeople with disabilities have rights and protections under the health care law, including coverage for pre-existing conditions, no annual or lifetime coverage limits, and free preventive care."}
