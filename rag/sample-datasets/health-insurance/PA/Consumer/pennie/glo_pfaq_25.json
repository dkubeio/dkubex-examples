A provider that has not contracted with your health insurance plan is called an \nout-of-network provider\n or \"\nnon-network provider\n.\"\nUsing providers in your health plans network will likely keep your healthcare costs lower. If you use an out-of-network provider, you probably will pay more for those services."}
