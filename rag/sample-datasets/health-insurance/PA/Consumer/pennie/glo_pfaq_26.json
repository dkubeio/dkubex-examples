There are many reasons why a health plan may not be accredited. For example, some plans have never gone through the accreditation process or have gone through the process with a different accrediting organization. Other plans are too new to be accredited or have started but not finished the accreditation process. Not being accredited doesn't mean that a plan is lower quality than a plan that's accredited."}
