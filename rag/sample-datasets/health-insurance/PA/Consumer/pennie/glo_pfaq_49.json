To reconcile, you compare two figures: the amount of premium tax credit you used in advance during the year \n(APTC)\n; and the amount of tax credit you \nactually \nqualified for based on your final income. Youll use IRS Form 8962 to reconcile. If you used more premium tax credit in advance than you actually qualified for, youll pay the difference with your federal taxes. If you used less, youll get the difference as a credit."}
