The monthly premium is usually lower, but because of the high deductible, you pay more healthcare costs yourself before the insurance company starts to pay its share. A high deductible plan (HDHP) can be combined with a health savings account (HSA), allowing you to pay for certain medical expenses with money free from federal taxes.\nThe IRS defines a high deductible health plan as any plan with a deductible of at least $1,350 for an individual or $2,700 for a family. An HDHP's total yearly out-of-pocket expenses (including deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance) can't be more than $6,650 for an individual or $13,300 for a family.
