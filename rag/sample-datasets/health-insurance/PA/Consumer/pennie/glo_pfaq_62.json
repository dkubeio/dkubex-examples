The lower the metal tier, the lower your monthly premium, but the more out-of-pocket costs you'll need to pay when you use healthcare services.\nIt is important to look at the total cost of health coverage - not just premiums - when choosing the right health coverage for you and your family. Total costs also include deductibles, and other \nout-of-pocket costs\n like \nco-payments\n and \nco-insurance\n.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nPlan Category\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe insurance company pays\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou pay (\nco-insurance\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatinum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n70%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBronze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich metal category is right for you?\n\nPlatinum\nHighest\n monthly premium\nLowest\n costs when you use healthcare services.\nDeductibles are very low, meaning your plan starts paying its share for covered services earlier than other plan categories.\nGood choice if:\n You usually use a lot of care and are willing to pay a higher monthly premium, knowing nearly all other costs will be covered.\n\nGold\nHigher\n monthly premium\nLower\n costs when you use healthcare services\nGold plan deductibles are usually low.\nGood choice if:\n Youre willing to pay more each month to have more costs covered when you use healthcare services.

You can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year depending on how much care you use.\nGood choice if:\n You qualify for cost-sharing reductions or, if not, youre willing to pay a slightly higher monthly premium than Bronze to have more of your routine care covered.\n\nBronze\nLowest\n monthly premium\nHighest\n costs when you use healthcare services.\nBronze plan deductibles  the amount of healthcare costs you pay yourself before your insurance plan starts to pay  can be thousands of dollars a year.\nGood choice if:\n You want a low-cost way to protect yourself from worst-case medical scenarios, like a serious illness or injury. Your monthly premium will be low, but youll have to pay for most routine care yourself.\n\nCatastrophic\nCatastrophic health insurance plans have low monthly premiums and very high deductibles. They may be an affordable way to protect yourself from worst-case scenarios, like getting seriously sick or injured. But you pay most routine medical expenses yourself.\nOnly the following people are eligible for catastrophic plans:\nPeople under 30\nPeople of any age with a hardship exemption or affordability exemption (based on Pennie or job-based insurance being unaffordable)"}
