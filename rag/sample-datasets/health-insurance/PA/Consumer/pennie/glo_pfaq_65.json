Once the grace period begins, you will have a set amount of time to pay the portion of your premium you are responsible for in full in order to avoid losing coverage.\n\nIf you enroll in coverage through Pennie and qualify for\nadvance premium tax credits\nand have paid at least one full months premium during the plan year, your grace period will be\n90 days\n. If you enroll in coverage through Pennie without APTC, the duration of the grace period is determined by your insurer but can be no less than 30 days as required by Pennsylvania law.\n\n90 days\nNOTE\n: Grace periods do not apply to your first\nmonths\npayment (Binder Payment). You must pay\nthe first months premium\n\n(\"binder payment\") with your insurance company\nto\ncomplete\nthe enrollment process. If you dont make your binder payment, your policy will not take effect and you will not be enrolled in coverage.\n\nNOTE\nAlso see:\nBinder Payments\nMaking your first and future premium payment\nHow long do I have to make my first premium payment?"}
