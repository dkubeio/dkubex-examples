While premiums are generally lower for catastrophic coverage, those enrolled in these plans are not eligible for financial assistance to lower the cost of coverage and care. These plans feature very high deductibles, before the plan starts to pay anything. However, after you meet the deductible, your insurance company will pay for all covered services, with no copayment or coinsurance.\nIf you're 30 or older and want to enroll in a Catastrophic plan for 2021, you must claim a hardship exemption or affordability exemption to qualify. If youre eligible to buy a Catastrophic plan, youll see them displayed when you compare plans on Pennie."}
