The customer will receive an eligibility determination notice from Virginia's Insurance Marketplace via their preferred mode of communication (email or postal mail) with information about how to resolve the DMI. Reminder notices will also be sent until the customer submits the correct documentation or the ROP has expired. This information will also be available on the customers account dashboard. The ROP is 90 calendar days and begins on the date the customer submits their application through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace.\n\nThe 90-day ROP will remain open until the requested documentation is provided by the consumer and approved by Virginia's Insurance Marketplace. It is important that consumers respond to Virginia's Insurance Marketplaces request for additional documentation within the 90-day ROP. If the requested documentation is not received within the 90-day ROP, Virginia's Insurance Marketplace may take administrative action, such as removing the consumers eligibility for federal financial assistance (Advance Premium Tax Credits), or the insurance policy may be terminated. The consumer will again be notified by Virginia's Insurance Marketplace of any action taken on their account through their preferred mode of communication.\n\nAfter the ROP expires, action can no longer be taken on that application, and the customer will need to reapply for coverage through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace. To avoid having administrative action taken on their account, consumers should read and respond to mail sent from Virginia's Insurance Marketplace to their home address, check their online Virginia's Insurance Marketplace\ninbox through their account portal for communications, and attempt to respond to Virginia's Insurance Marketplaces request for additional documentation within the 90-day ROP.\n\nIf a consumer has questions regarding their monthly insurance premium, they should contact Virginia's Insurance Marketplace customer service directly at 1-888-687-1502."}
