If an individual or family applies for coverage through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace, determined eligible for Medicaid or FAMIS, their application will be automatically transferred to DMAS to be enrolled in coverage. If an individual is assessed as potentially eligible for Medicaid or FAMIS, their application will also be automatically transferred to DMAS to check if they are able to enroll in coverage through those programs."}
