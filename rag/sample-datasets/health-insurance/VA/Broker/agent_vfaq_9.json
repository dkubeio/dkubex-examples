Virginia's Insurance Marketplace relied on the data provided by Healthcare.gov and producers during pre-registration to link customers with their agent. If you successfully completed the pre-registration contact form by September 7, your customers (with PY 2023 enrollments) who were migrated from the FFM should appear in your Virginia Insurance Marketplace Book of Business.\nThere are a few reasons a client may not appear in an agent Book of Business:\n- You did not submit a fully accurate and complete contact form.\n- A customer may not have been successfully linked to you as their agent.\n- The customer could have de-designated you as their agent of record.\nThe good news is Virginia's Insurance Marketplace makes it easy for agents to find customers who were not attached to their Book of Business.\n- Agents can search for a customer with the consumer's name and social security number and self-designate as the agent of record.\n- Customers can also search for an agent in the platform and send a request to that agent to be added. These functions can be done at any time.\n- Agents can request a customer to re-designate you as their agent. To learn more, see How does a customer find and designate a producer?\n- You can always contact the Virginia Insurance Marketplace\nfor additional assistance in determining why the customer no longer designated or to get help adding a customer to your Book of Business."}
