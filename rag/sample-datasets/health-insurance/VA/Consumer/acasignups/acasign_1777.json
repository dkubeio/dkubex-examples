The preliminary 2021 rate filings for the WV individual marekt is around a 4.8% average increase.\nI have no idea what the enrollment numbers are for WV's small group carriers, so I can't run a weighted average, but theunweightedaverage increase for 2021 comes in at around 3.8% across the five sm. group carriers:\n \n"}
