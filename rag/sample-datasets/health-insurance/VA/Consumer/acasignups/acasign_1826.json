This year, however, due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic, I presume, they didn't actually post them until mid-August.\nThe average premium changes for 2021 on the individual marketrange from a 13% drop to a 7.7% increase, with the statewide weighted average coming in at around a 7.2% reduction.For the small group market, premiums are increasing by around 3.6% on average, ranging from a 2.4% drop to a 10.9% increase.\nTwo other noteworthy items: First, Optimum Choice is expanding into VA's individual market (this isn't the same as Optima Health); secondly, VA's indy market has dropped from over 300,000 last year to around 256,000 this year, presumably due to the lingering effects of Medicaid expansion enrollees shifting over from subsidized private plans.\n \n"}
