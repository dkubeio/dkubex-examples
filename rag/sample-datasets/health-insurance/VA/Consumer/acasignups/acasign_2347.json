By 2019 this had spread to almost all of them. For 2020, every stateexceptMississippi, Indiana and West Virginia are doing so. What are theydoing instead? \"Broad Loading\":\nIn response, most states allowed or required insurers to silver load, which means they built the cost of CSRs into silver plan premiums only. But six states, including West Virginia, required insurers to broad load, meaning they built CSR costs into premiums for all metal levels. Since then, three more states shifted from broad loading to silver loading. But not West Virginia.\nWhile enrollment in the ACAs marketplaces declined by nine percent nationally between 2017 and 2019, West Virginias Marketplace saw a much larger drop of 34 percent, the second-highest decline in the nation. Silver loading has driven a significant drop in the premiums that subsidy-eligible enrollees pay in most states, but in West Virginia net premiums for this population have increased by 16 percent, the largest increase in the country.\nThere is a potential downside to Silver Loading forunsubsidizedenrollees, of course...but only if they're enrolled in Silver plans. They can avoid the CSR hit by either switching to Bronze or Gold plans as wellor(in many states) by enrolling in a \"mirrored Silver\" plan off-exchange (this gets into something called the \"Silver Switcharoo\", which I wrote about two years ago). According to Allen, however, there's been minimal downside to silver loading in other states, while broad loading in WV has led to substantial harm to unsubsidized enrollees as well as those who are subsidized.\n"}
