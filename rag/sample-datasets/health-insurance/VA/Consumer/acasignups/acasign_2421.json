The data for 2018 MLR rebates won't be officially posted for another month or so, but I've managed to acquire it early, and after a lot of number-crunching the data, I've recompiled it into an easy-to-read format.\nBut that's not all! In addition to the actual 2018 MLR rebates, I've gone one step further and have taken an early crack at trying to figure out what 2019 MLR rebates might end up looking like next year (for the Individual Market only). In order to do this, I had to make several very large assumptions:\nAll three of these are very questionable, of course, but they at least provide a baseline.\nAll that being said, here's what the payments for 2018 going out this monthlook like in West Virginia:\nhere's what the payments for 2018 going out this monthlook like in West Virginia:\n \n \nAGAIN: There's absolutely no guarantee that things will play out this way.
