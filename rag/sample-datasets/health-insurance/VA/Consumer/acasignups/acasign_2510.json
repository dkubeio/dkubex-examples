I was ble to find the hard enrollment number for CareSource, while both HighMark and Optum are redacted, so I based my enrollment estimates on 83% of last year's (WV's total ACA exchange enrollment dropped 17% this year). Even if that ratio is off, it won't make that much of a difference since the two are pretty close anyway (+5.9% and +6.5% respectively).\nStatewide, unsubsidized West Virginians will be seeing roughly a 6.7% average increase...to a whopping $1,000/month on average, one of the highest rates in the country. Of course, WV is also one of the few states which, to my knowledge, isstillrefusing to Silver Load or Silver Switch their premium increases, which makes it even worse for the few unsubsidized enrollees they have.\nMeanwhile, theunweighted average increase on the WV small group market is +11.2%.\n \n"}
