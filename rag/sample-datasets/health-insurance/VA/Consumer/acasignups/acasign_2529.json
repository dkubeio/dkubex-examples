At the time, the 10 carriers participating in VA's individual market (one of which is new for 2020) were asking for average increases of 2.9% statewide:\n \nHowever, \"preliminary\" is the key word here. Not only do the filings have to be reviewed and signed off on by state insurance regulators, sometimes there are other developments which cause one or more carriers to re-file with either lower (or occasionally higher) rate changes for various reasons. Some requests are approved as is, but in some states there's a lot of back & forth before the final, approved rates are locked in.\nCase in point: Check out the updated rate filing summary for Virginia as of July 11th. According to this, rate changes for five of the ten carriers have stayed the same...but the other five have been significantly reduced:\nCombined, these changes dramatically reduce Virginia's unsubsidized 2020 rate changes from a 2.9% increase to a 3.6%decrease.\nAs an aside, I've also gone ahead and plugged in VA's small group market, which is a bit larger than the Individual market; those rates are going up around 7.7% next year.\n \n"}
