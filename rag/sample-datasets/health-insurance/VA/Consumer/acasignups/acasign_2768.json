They've wisely separated it into those earning less than 100% of the Federal Poverty Line (166,000) and those earning between 100-138% FPL (67,300). The second group are the ones who would have been enrolled in heavily subsidized ACA exchange policies until the end of 2018.\nAgain, I doubt that all 67.3K enrollees dropped their ACA plans--some of them were probably uninsured at all, or had their circumstances change recently--but the odds are good that the vast bulk fo them did so. 67.3K vs. 72K is a pretty close matchup. My 85K estimate might have proven to be too high, but it was still in the ballpark.\n"}
