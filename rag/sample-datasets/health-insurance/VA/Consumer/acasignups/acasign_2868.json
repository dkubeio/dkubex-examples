For example, a single adult with an annual income at or below $16,754 may be eligible for coverage. An adult in a three-person family with a total household annual income at or below $28,677 may be eligible.\nSNAP recipients and parents whose children are currently receiving Medicaid coverage have the opportunity to use a short-form application to sign up if they do so by January 4, 2019. These individuals were notified by letter earlier this fall, and a follow-up postcard was recently mailed to potentially eligible adults in these categories.\nWe urge these moms, dads, and other Virginians to watch for the yellow postcard in the mail and to call our Cover Virginia Call Center right away, said Secretary of Health and Human Resources Daniel Carey, M.D. We already have a relationship with these individuals, so they need to answer just three simple questions to determine their eligibility. We want everyone in their families to have access to comprehensive health services, including visits to primary and specialty care doctors, hospital stays and prescription medications.\nThe enrollment period for Marketplace health plans has ended, but Virginians can apply for Medicaid at any time of the year. We encourage everyone who does not have health insurance to consider applying for high-quality, low- or no-cost coverage today, said Dr. Jennifer Lee, Director of the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services. We are inspired by the many men and women who have shared their stories and reminded us that good health empowers our citizens to be more engaged and productive in their work, family life, and communities.\nThe Cover Virginia Call Center has received more than 140,000 calls since it began accepting Medicaid applications under the new eligibility rules on November 1. The call center logged more than 6,000 calls on November 1, the largest number in a single day since the facility first opened in July 2001. That record was broken on November 26 when total calls exceeded 7,000.\n\n"}
