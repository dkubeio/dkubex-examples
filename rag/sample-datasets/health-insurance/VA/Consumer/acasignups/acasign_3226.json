The continued delays and procedural stall tactics that we are seeing from the Senate create uncertainty for families and local governments, threaten Virginias bond rating and run afoul of this Commonwealths reputation for efficient and effective government.\nThis unnecessary delay is made more insulting to Virginians by the reality that the House of Delegates passed a budget that expands health care weeks ago, and a majority of Senators have indicated they would vote for a similar measure if the Senate would simply put one on the floor. Virginians have waited long enough. Its time to pass a budget that expands Medicaid and invests in the future of our economy.\n(sigh) Ah, well. They've waited 8 years, I guess they'll have to wait one more week.\nMeanwhile, over at healthinsurance.org, Louise Norris has an important update about that eyebrow-raising bill which I wrote about a couple of weeks ago:\nGov. Ralph Northam signed a new healthcare bill into law that will provide relief to many small business owners currently struggling with the Central Virginia insurance premium crisis.\nMembers of local advocacy group Charlottesville For Reasonable Health Insurance had provided testimony at the Virginia General Assembly and organized an email campaign, helping to ensure passage of the bill through the legislative session. Introduced by Sen. Creigh Deeds and effective July 1 2018, SB672 will allow self-employed people to take advantage of the much more affordable health plans in the small group business marketplace, without having to hire employees.\nAs you'll recall, what SB672 will do--assuming it's actually enacted--is basically allow sole proprietors or spousal teams (such as my wife and I, assuming we lived in Virginia) to declare ourselves a Small Business for purposes of enrolling in the Small Group market instead of using the Individual market.\nThe basic idea is this:\nHowever, there's some pretty obvious downsides to this, which the folks who came up with the idea in the first place are well aware of. As Norris explained to me two weeks ago:\nWell, Norris says there's been some further clarification...but some of it only makes the situation even murkier:\nBut that appears to conflict with the ACA, which requires a small business to have at least one employee in addition to the owner (and not a spouse of the owner) in order to enroll in a plan in the small group market. Indeed, the impact statement for S.B.672 notes that the legislation may conflict with the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nThere has been some confusion about whether S.B.672 was intended to align the states regulations with the federal governments proposed regulations for association health plans...But that does not appear to be the case.\n...our intent was to allow a self-employed person to purchase a plan in the small group market. We received confirmation from BOI last week that effective July 1, BOI will require insurance carriers to offer small group plans to self-employed individuals (sole-proprietors, single owner LLCs).\nThe Virginia Bureau of Insurance...clarified that self-employed people  without any additional employees  will be able to purchase coverage in the small group market, year-round, after the legislation takes effect in July.\nIn other words, as far as the state is concerned, bullet point #3 above isn't an issue: These would be considered fully ACA-compliant small group plans. The problem, of course, is that they would violate the ACA on that very point, setting up a state/federal legal showdown. Would CMS intervene as they did in Idaho? Who knows...\nAllowing a self-employed person without any employees to purchase a small group plans is very different from the concept of allowing self-employed people to join associations and thus gain access to large group plans (which is what the Trump Administration has proposed). Its unclear at this point whether the impact of the Virginia legislation will run afoul of federal rules, and if it does, whether the Trump Administration will step in and require modifications.\nTHIS is the critical thing to understand:\nThe small group market and individual market are subject to nearly identical regulations under the ACA...\nBut one key difference is the availability of coverage. Small group plans are available year-round, as long as the employer meets the insurers minimum participation requirements...In the individual market, however, coverage is only available during open enrollment...\nIf S.B.672 allows a self-employed person (without employees) unrestricted access to the small group market as an alternative to the individual market, its easy to see how that might incentivize people who are self-employed to skip coverage in the individual market, and then enroll in a small-group plan mid-year, if and when they end up needing health care.\nIn other words, even if CMS looks the other way and allows SB 672 to go into effect...the residents of Charlottesville may find that there's no one there to actually buy an insurance policy from:\nWhen I addressed that issue with the Virginia Bureau of Insurance, they said that its too early to tell how insurers might address this issue. Anthem/Health Keepers clarified that as of May, they continue to require at least two non-married enrollees in order to qualify for a small group plan, and couldnt say at that point what their future plans were.\nStay tuned, this is only gonna get dicier...\n"}
