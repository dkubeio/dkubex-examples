Rosalyn R. Dance, D-Petersburg. Even if its corrected, theyre still held hostage for 2018.\nYup. Tomorrow is the signing deadline, so even if Congress actually does formally appropriate the CSR funding for 2018, the rates will be locked in (this would change starting in 2019, but that doesn't do anyone any good this year). How much of the rate increase is due specifically to the CSR issue? My best guess is that it's around 14.3 points, or about 25% of the total increase, which is actually a much lower portion of the total than most other states so far.\nI've reposted the approved rate data for both the individual and small group markets below, straight from the VA Dept. of Insurance. As you can see, the small group market looks much more reasonable, ranging from about a 3% drop to 13% increases depending on the carrier.\n \n"}
