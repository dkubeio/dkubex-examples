As a result, the continued uncertainty makes it difficult for us to offer Individual health plans statewide in Virginia.\nEffective in January of 2018, Anthem said it will \"not participate on the individual exchange in Virginia and will reduce its plan offering and will only offer off-exchange plans in Washington and Scott Counties and the city of Bristol, VA.\"\nSeptember 7, 2017:\nUnfortunately, yesterday Optima Health announced that while they will be offering policies both on & off the ACA exchange next year, they're pulling out of a whole bunch of counties:\nNORFOLK, Va.Optima Health announced today it will continue to participate in the Individual market, offering plans both on and off the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Exchange, in Virginia in 2018.\nFrom day one, our desire has been to find a way to stay in the ACA Exchange, said Michael M. Dudley, President and CEO, Optima Health.\nWith three national insurersAnthem, Aetna and UnitedHealthcareleaving the market, over 350,000 Virginians will be losing their healthcare coverage on January 1, 2018. The exiting of carriers along with the uncertainty in Washington, presented unprecedented circumstances.\nThe decisions we made were challenging ones given the recent changes and ambiguities in the marketplace, said Dudley. Our most recent filing with the state reflects these dynamic changes, as would be expected in these circumstances.\nOptima Health is limiting its Individual plans offered on and off the 2018 ACA Exchange to locations where there are Sentara Healthcare hospitals and physicians. This will allow Optima Health to better manage chronic conditions to keep members healthy.\nThis move apparently means that the \"bare county\" problem--which was recently thought to be resolved with companies like Centene moving in to cover the last counties without any carriers participating--is back again: 63 of Virginia's 133 counties (technically 95 plus 38 \"independent cities\") are now facing no exchange carriers whatsoever. This will apparently leave around 70,000 current exchange enrollees without any carriers to switch to unless another carrier jumps in at the last minute.\nSeptember 14, 2017:\n#ACASignups U.S. Senator @timkaine is basically threatening carriers that the solution to bare counties will be Medicare option.\n  Charles Gaba  (@charles_gaba) September 14, 2017\nAWESOME! Sen. @TimKaine: The insurance companies are holding a knife up to their own throat by allowing bare counties.\n  Charles Gaba  (@charles_gaba) September 14, 2017\nIts one thing for a carrier to say we need to raise rates X% to participate; its something else to say they wont participate AT ALL.\n  Charles Gaba  (@charles_gaba) September 14, 2017\nSeptember 15, 2017:\nAnthem Changes Course, Will Offer Obamacare Plans In 63 Virginia Counties And Cities\nAnthem said it has revised its plan to offer individual health insurance in Virginia after learning that 63 counties and cities would be bare and have no access to coverage in 2018 under the Affordable Care Act.\nIts welcome news to Virginia residents but also a good move for Anthem, the nation's second-larges health insurer, which appears to be maintaining individual coverage in areas of the country where it will have a monopoly. Anthem has been scaling back in some of the 14 states where it operates under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand, but remaining in areas that are in jeopardy of not having an Obamacare choice for 2018.\nThere you have it. Every county in Virginia is now covered by at least one carrier for 2018 again. Yes, they jacked up their rates to cover the Cost Sharing Reduction reimbursements being sabotaged by Trump, as well as the threat by HHS Sec. Tom Price not to enforce the individual mandate...to the tune of a whopping 56% on average, according to Louise Norris, who also notes that, since they'll only be staying in half the state, the new filing only applies to around 61,000 current enrollees. That means the other 104,000 mentioned in Anthem's earlier filing will still have to shop around for a new plan from Optima. Anyone receiving subsidies via HC.gov policies shouldnt be impacted since their tax credits will increase accordingly, but the unsubsidized nrollees are kind of screwed.\nStill a hell of a lot better than no carriers, however.\nHere's what the statewide average rate hikes now look like...around 34.3% if CSRs are paid, 48.6% if they aren't:\n\n"}
