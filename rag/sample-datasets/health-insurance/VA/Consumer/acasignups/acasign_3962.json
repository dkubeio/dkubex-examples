I'm not sure if this is chance or if they simply have the earliest filing deadline. I'm guessing the latter, because, as Zach Tracer noted earlier today,Virginia is again the first state to list their 2018 Individual and Small Group Market participants. Remember, these areinitialfilings only, andvery muchsubject to change throughout the summer and early fall. Here's who Tracer says has stated is committing to being on the ACA exchanges this fall...at the moment, anyway:\nThat's 9 on the individual market total, 3 of which say they'll also be on the SHOP (Small Business) exchange as well, although let's face it at this point SHOP is pretty much a rounding error in most states. The only one on the exchange thisyearmissing from the listis UnitedHealthcare, although \"Golden Rule\" is a United subsidiary available off-exchange only this year.\nActually, some of the carriers doalready have initial paperwork submitted to the state's SERFF system; here's what I see so far for 2018:\nIndividual Market:\nSmall Group Market:\nI'm not gonna make too much of these this early on; again, some of these could easily change, and obviously the 4 missing carriers from the individual market list at the top haven't been added to the SERFF database yet. Plus, again, there's no actual rates yet.\nHowever, thisdoessuggest that in Virginia, at least, the carriers don't appear to be fleeing for the hills...yet.\n"}
