Thankfully, the impact is nominal in Virginia, as only1,800 people are being impacted total.\nIt's also worth noting that \"grandfathered\" enrollees only make up around 11% of Humana's total Virginia individual market as of this spring, which is somewhat higher thanmy overall ballparkestimate of around 1 million nationally.\n\n\n"}
