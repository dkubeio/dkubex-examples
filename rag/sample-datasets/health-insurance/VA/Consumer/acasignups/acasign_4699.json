The solution was staring me in the face all along...\nThu, 04/14/2016 - 12:39pm\nSo, yesterday I posted my first 2017 Weighted Average Rate Hike entry, using Virginia, since they appear to be the first state to post their requested rate changes for 2017.\nAs you can see, while the requested rate increases stayed consistent throughout the various updates, thenumber of enrolleeschanged dramatically depending on which filing source I used. Case in point: Anthem/HealthKeepers Inc.\nThe first filing I found for Anthem HealthKeepers made it pretty clear that they're asking for a 15.8% average rate hike next year which is expected to potentially impact up to 122,581 policy holders:\n\nPretty cut & dry, right? Note that according to the filing that number covers current Anthem HealthKeepers enrollees both onandoff the exchange, so it should cover all ACA-compliant policies.\nHOWEVER, according to this cover letter, submitted as part of the same batch of forms as the one above, they'reactuallyexpecting the rate hikes to impact190,000Virginians:\n\nThe letter doesn't mention the 15.8% figure, but it doeslist the low and high range, which matches exactly with the 9.3% and 22.6% listed in the other form, so this is definitely referring to the same policies.\nSo, how big of a deal is this? Well, let's go back to my table from yesterday:\n\nAs you can see, with 122.5K enrollees, Anthem's 15.8% hike request results in an overall average increaseof 17.86%.\nIf you replace this with 190,000 people, however, without changing anything else, it looks like this:\n\nThe state-wide weighted average drops by 4/10ths of a percentage point based on this edit alone.\nDon't get me wrong, a 17.5% hike still isn't pretty, but this at least illustrates what a pain in the ass it is to try and estimate these things, and once again shows that you have to take the headlines which we'll no doubt be seeing all summer and early fall with a huge grain of salt.\nUPDATE: D'OH!! A huge thank you to FarmbellPSU in the comments for pointing out the obvious--that 122,581 figure from the actual filing refers to the number ofpolicy holders,NOTthe number ofcovered lives!\nUPDATE:\nThe next four pagesafterthat give the number of covered lives for each individual plan...and when you add them all up, voila, they add up to roughly 190,000 people!\nFortunately, the other carrier filings didn't separate out every individual plan, but instead grouped\"covered lives\" into larger categories, so I was able to plug in the correct numbers more easily than Anthem.\nFunny thing is, theratioof covered lives to policyholders stayed about the same across all of the carriers, which means that theweighted averagestill ends up roughly the same:\n\nYup...17.83%, which is almost exactly what it was in the first place (17.86%). The relative market shares stayed the same, but the grand total did go up substantially, to 420,000.\nVirginia enrolled about 422,000 people through the exchange...but theoff-exchangeACA-compliant policies are still missing, so the matching number is a coincidence. The remaining individual enrollees can presumably be found in the blank Humana and Coventry lines.\nSo, how many are missing? Hard to say. Nationally, I've spitballed theoff-exchange individual market (notincluding grandfathered/transitional policies) at roughly 6 million. If this is accurate and proportional in Virginia, that should mean around 650,000 state-wide, or roughly 230,000 missing enrollees, but I have no way of knowing that. It's possible that Virginia only has around 100K ACA-compliant off-exchange.\nIn any event, Humana and Coventry appear to be being dropped in Virginia's individual market, sowithout knowing how much their enrollees were paying (or where they'll move to next year), it's impossible to factor them into a weighted average. So, until further notice, it looks like I had it right in the first place: Virginia'srequestedaverage 2017 rate hike is around 17.9%.\n"}
