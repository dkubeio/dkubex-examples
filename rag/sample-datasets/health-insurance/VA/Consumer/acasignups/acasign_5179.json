In addition, there's a couple of new additions to each (UHC of Mid-Atlantic on the indy market, Federated Mutual on the sm. group market). However, none of these have large enough enrollment numbers toamount to more than a rounding error in either category.\nTherefore,assuming all current enrollees stay exactly where they are now,weighted average 2016premiums will increase 8.5% on the individual market and 2.9% in the small group market.\n"}
