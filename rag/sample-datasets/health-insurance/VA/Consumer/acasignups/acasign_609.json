As a result, up to an additional15,000 people annually including 12,000 inIndiana and 3,000 in West Virginia  will now be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP for a full year after pregnancy.With todays approval, in combination with previously approved state extensions, an estimated 333,000 Americans annually in 23 states and D.C. are eligible for 12 months of postpartum coverage. If all states adopted this option, as many as 720,000 people across the United States annually would be guaranteed Medicaid and CHIP coverage for 12 months after pregnancy.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has made expanding access to high-quality, affordable health care a top priority  and because of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and other Administration efforts, more people than ever before have health insurance coverage. Extending Medicaid postpartum coverage is an important part of these efforts.\nEnsuring mothers get the care they need after giving birth is a core part of our effort to address the nations maternal health crisis, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. Thanks to President Bidens American Rescue Plan, now 333,000 families across the nation can access health care coverage for a full year after pregnancy  and have the peace of mind that comes with it. We thank Indiana and West Virginia for joining our efforts to support healthy mothers and families, and we call on all remaining states to take advantage of the opportunity to provide this critical care.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has championed policies to improve maternal health and equity since the President and Vice President first took office. In April 2021, President Biden issued the first-ever Presidential Proclamation marking Black Maternal Health Week. In December 2021, Vice President Harris hosted the first-ever White House Maternal Health Day of Action, where she announced important commitments to address the maternal health crisis. The Vice President also issued a call to action to the private and public sectors to improve maternal health outcomes, where she urged states to extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum women from 2 months to 12 months, and announced guidance for how states can extend their coverage. Additionally, she convened a historic meeting with Cabinet secretaries and agency leaders to discuss the Administrations whole-of-government approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity. Todays announcement is part of HHS ongoing effort to support safe pregnancies and childbirth, eliminate pregnancy-related health disparities, and improve health outcomes for parents and infants across our country.\nIn June, the White House released theBiden-Harris Administrations Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, a whole-of-government approach to combatting maternal mortality and morbidity. For far too many people, complications related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period can lead to devastating health outcomes and result in hundreds of deaths each year. This maternal health crisis is particularly devastating for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native people, and those in rural communities, who all experience maternal mortality and morbidity at significantly higher rates than their white and urban counterparts.\nIn July, CMS released itsMaternity Care Action Planto support the implementation of the Biden-Harris Administrations Blueprint, which includes postpartum coverage extensions through Medicaid and CHIP. The action plan takes a holistic and coordinated approach across CMS to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities for people during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. CMS implementation of the action plan will support the Biden-Harris Administrations broad vision and call to action to improve maternal health.\nIndiana and West Virginia join an expanding list of state partners choosing to prioritize health care coverage in the critical first year after pregnancy, said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. The American Rescue Plan serves as a foundation to support the health and wellbeing of postpartum women and families. Now, as part of the Administrations Maternal Health Blueprint and CMS Maternity Care Action Plan, were continuing the work to make improved maternal health a reality for communities across the country.\nThis extension of coverage was made possible by anew state plan authority established by the ARP, under which states may extend postpartum coverage in their Medicaid and CHIP programs from the current mandatory 60-day period to 12 months. Indiana and West Virginia are the latest states to extend Medicaid and CHIP coverage for 12 months following pregnancy, joining California; Connecticut; Florida; Hawaii; Illinois; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; New Jersey; New Mexico; Ohio; Oregon; South Carolina; Tennessee; Virginia; Washington state; and Washington, D.C. CMS continues to work with states that have proposed adoptingthe ARP option to extend postpartum coverage to 12 months.\nMedicaid covers 42% of all births in the nationand more than half of all children in the country. This new option for states to extend Medicaid and CHIP postpartum coverage is part of ongoing efforts through HHS and the Biden-Harris Administration to address disparities in maternal health outcomes by opening the door to postpartum care for hundreds of thousands of people. Extending Medicaid postpartum coverage is an important part of these efforts, as highlighted in the Biden-Harris Administrations Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis and CMS recently releasedMaternity Care Action Plan.

The postpartum period is critical for recovering from childbirth, addressing complications of delivery, ensuring mental health, managing infant care, and transitioning from obstetric to primary care.\nVisit Medicaid.gov to learn more about theMedicaidandCHIPstate plan amendment extension of postpartum coverage in Indiana and West Virginia.\n"}
