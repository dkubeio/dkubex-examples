I made a big stink about this bizarro story when it broke back in June, so it behooves me to post a follow-up now when it appears that at least one Democrat in Virginia (well, besides the \"Democrat\" who was the subject of the original bribe offer) was basically guilty of the same thing that the state Republicans were:\nRICHMOND Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffes top lieutenant apologized Friday after admitting that he had tried to keep a Democrat from quitting the evenly divided state Senate with the prospect of a lucrative state job for the senators daughter.\nBut it was not entirely clear to Richmonds increasingly bewildered and antsy political class just what Chief of Staff Paul Reagan had done.\nHad he engaged in a crass and potentially illegal bidding war with Republicans who, in the middle of a standoff over the state budget and Medicaid expansion, wanted Democrat Phillip P. Puckett out of the Senate as desperately as McAuliffes administration wanted him in?\nOr had Reagan merely committed politics as usual with one decidedly inconvenient twist: a voice-mail message that eventually put his sausage-making on public display?\nThe short version, as you may recall, was this:\nHowever, there's been another twist: Apparently in response to the situation,beforePuckett resigned, McAuliffe's top aide decided to respond bypossiblycounter-offering adifferentjob to Puckett's daughter in return for himnotresigning/flipping sideson the Medicaid issue.\nOn the one hand, McAuliffe apparently didn't know anything about the \"counter-offer\", and there was no specific offer made by his assistant, so it doesn't appear to have been as clear-cut as the original GOP offer.\nOn the other hand, \"well, they did it first!!\" isn't a particularly noble defense for being caught doing something so clearly wrong.\nSo, in the end, Puckett resigns, the GOP gains control of the state Senate, McAuliffe is embarrassed, and hundreds of thousands of Virginians continue to be utterly screwed over by Republican asshattery...which leaves just one question for me:\nWhat exactly does Puckett's daughter,Martha P. Ketron (who, from what I can tell, doesn't appear to have been involved inanyof this idiocy)feel about the whole situation, and just how awkward is their familyThanksgiving dinner going to be this year?\n"}
