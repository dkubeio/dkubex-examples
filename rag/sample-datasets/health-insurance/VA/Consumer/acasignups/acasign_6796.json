This means the state has now enrolled nearly 89% of them:\n\"The fast-track enrollments, on average, cost West Virginia about $6.50 less than would a full Medicaid application,\" the report states, estimating the staff worker received $14 dollars per hour.\nMultiplying the 71,860 people who enrolled by that dollar amount provided a savings of roughly $470,000, according to the report. The state spent $200,000 in IT upgrades that also allowed it to mine the SNAP data base for potentially eligible residents. Subtracting those costs, the report argues the state saved about $270,000.\nBowling said the most up-to-date data show about 128,000 people have joined Medicaid through the expansion, much more than the roughly 91,000 anticipated to sign up. She said that success means the state probably won't send out another round of letters, but the numbers keep rising as those eligible may sign up at any time.\n"}
