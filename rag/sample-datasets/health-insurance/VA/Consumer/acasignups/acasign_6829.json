McAuliffe pushing Medicaid expansion through in spite of GOP dick move\nSat, 06/21/2014 - 10:12am\nGood for him. Not only is this the right thing to do, assuming it goes through (it sounds like the logistics will be a bit awkward to implement under the circumstances), it also makes the Virginia Republican Party look like even bigger jackasses than they already did(and don't even get me started on the former Democratic state Senator who agreed to their bribery scheme).\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said on Friday that he planned to act administratively to expand health coverage in his state, defying the Republican-controlled legislature that maneuvered to block him from expanding Medicaid under Obamacare.\nThe specifics of McAuliffe's plan aren't clear. But he vetoed an item in the Virginia budget Friday that would have required the legislature to approve any expansion and asserted that he planned to \"move administratively\" to expand coverage to as many as 400,000 low-income Virginians.\nSo, assuming this works out, 400,000 Virginians will end up receiving healthcare coverage after all, Gov. McAuliffe will have kept a campaign promise, the VA Dems will have rid themselves of a complete jerk...and the VA GOP will have wasted a tremendous amount of time, energy and political capital (as well as potentially committing a felony?) for absolutely no reason whatsoever.\n"}
