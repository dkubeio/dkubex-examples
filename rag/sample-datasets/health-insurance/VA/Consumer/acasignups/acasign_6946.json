According to Earley, the discrepancy likely is because Highmark has eliminated from its final enrollment numbers people who did not pay their first month's premium or missed payments between Oct. 1 and March.\n\"Our numbers show who have enrolled with us as of today, Earley said, and we'll still be processing people who've signed up in April and May to reach a final number.\"\nOK, did you catch that?\nIn other words, in West Virginia, 93.8% of all exchange QHP enrollees have paid their first month's premium, and that's as of May 1st.\nThis ishigherthan the 93% \"paid or will pay\" figure that I've been assuming all along.\nThanks for playing, GOP. Next?\n"}
