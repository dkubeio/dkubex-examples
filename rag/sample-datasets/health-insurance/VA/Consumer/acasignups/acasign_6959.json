According to Jeremiah Samples, deputy secretary for the states Department of Health and Human Resources, West Virginia has enrolled 117,522 people in expanded Medicaid  more than twice the 63,000 that actuarial studies had predicted for the first year of enrollment.\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the total number of people eligible for ACA Medicaid expansion in WV is around 143,000...meaning that they've managed to achieve an amazing 82% of this goal in the just 7 months.\n"}
