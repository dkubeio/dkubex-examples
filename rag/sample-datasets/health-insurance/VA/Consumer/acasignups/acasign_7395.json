Most importantly, itspecifically statesthat these 87K are in Medicaiddue to the ACA expansionprovision, an important clarification.\nAccording to West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services, over 87,000 residents have been enrolled for health care coverage through the Medicaid Expansion...\nJeremiah Samples, assistant secretary for the DHHS, said that number is about 70 percent of everyone eligible for the expansion....\nThe total estimated number of West Virginians eligible for coverage under the expansion is 130,000, according to Samples.\nBy Feb. 13, a total of 87,135 people have enrolled, which Samples said is about 25,000 more than the projected number for 2014.\nUnfortunately, this also means that even though the actual total Medicaid number has increased by 16.5K, I've had to reduce the total on the spreadsheet by39,600 to remove any \"normal churn\" or \"woodwork\" enrollees. This means a smaller but more accurate total on the Medicaid/CHIP side.\n"}
