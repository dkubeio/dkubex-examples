This allowed insurance carriers to file modified rates for 2024 whichincludethe reinsurance program being in place.\nAs a result, the final, approved rates for Virginia's ACA individual market next year will only go up by a nominal amount...just over 1% on average.\nMeanwhile, the approved small group market rates will increase by around 7.3% overall, down only slightly from the 7.5% requested increase.\n \n"}
