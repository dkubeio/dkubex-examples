What is the difference between the Marketplace and Medicaid? The Marketplace was created for Virginia, by Virginians, and lets you shop for, compare, and purchase affordable, high-quality health insurance plans with comprehensive coverage. The Marketplace is the only place to get financial assistance to help lower the cost of coverage and care. Virginians who are uninsured, are self-employed, or have jobs that dont provide affordable insurance options can use the Marketplace to shop for health plans that fit their budget. Virginia Medicaid has low-cost and no-cost health coverage programs. There are programs for children, pregnant women, and adults, including those with disabilities. The Marketplace will determine Medicaid eligibility and will let Virginians know if they qualify for Medicaid instead of a health plan on the Marketplace. How do I find a plan that fits my budget and meets my needs? When choosing a plan, its a good idea to think about your total health care costs, not just the premium you pay to your insurance company every month. Other out-of-pocket costs, like coinsurance or a copayment, can have a big effect on your total health care spending. To pick a plan based on your total care costs, you need to estimate how much care youre likely to use for the year ahead. When you compare plans in the Marketplace, you can choose each family members expected medical use as low, medium, or high. When you view plans, you see an estimate of your total costs - including monthly premiums and all out-of-pocket costs - based on your households expected use of care.Marketplace plans are sorted into 5 metal categories: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Catastrophic. These categories are based on how you and the health plan share the total costs of your care. Generally, plan types with higher premiums (Gold and Platinum) pay more of your total costs of care. Types with lower premiums (Bronze and Silver) pay less of your total costs.If youre under age 30, you can enroll in a Catastrophic plan whether you have an exemption or not. If youre age 30 or older, you can enroll in this plan category only if you qualify for a hardship exemption (this includes affordability exemptions). How do I find a plan category that works for me? If you expect to have a lot of doctor visits or need regular prescriptions, you may want a Gold or Platinum plan. These plans generally have higher monthly premiums but pay more of your costs when you need care. If you dont expect to use regular medical services and dont take regular prescriptions, you may want a Silver, Bronze, or Catastrophic plan. These plans cost you less per month but pay less of your costs when you need care. If you qualify for extra savings on out-of-pocket costs, your best value may be a Silver plan.NOTE: If you qualify for a cost-sharing reduction based on your income, you can have a lower deductible and pay lower out-of-pocket costs (including copayments and coinsurance) when you get care - but only if you enroll in a Silver plan. How can I make changes to my plan or update my account information? Once you create an account on the Marketplace, you can log in anytime and update your information in your profile settings. Is vision included in the health plans on the Marketplace? All plans offered by the Marketplace include vision coverage for children. Only some plans include vision coverage for adults. If adult vision coverage is important to you, check the details of any plan you're considering.If your plan doesn't include adult vision coverage, you can buy a stand-alone vision plan to reduce your vision care expenses. However, the Marketplace doesn't offer stand-alone vision plans. To shop for stand-alone vision plans, contact an insurance agentor search for plans online. Is dental included in the health plans on the Marketplace? Pediatric dental care is considered an essential health benefit. This means that any health plans for children age 18 or younger must include dental coverage. However, dental coverage isn't an essential health benefit for adults. Insurers don't have to offer adult dental coverage as part of their qualified health plan; but you can shop for stand-alone dental plans through the Marketplace. If you choose a separate dental plan, youll pay a separate, additional premium. Health Plan Enrollment When can I enroll in a health plan?

Can I use the Marketplace if my employer does not offer affordable health insurance?

If a family has to pay more for the employer-sponsored plan, they will potentially be eligible for premium tax credits through the Marketplace. For 2024, the percentage is 8.39%. What is Form 1095-A and what do I do with it? If anyone in your household had a Marketplace plan in the previous year, you should receive a 1095-A Health Insurance Marketplace statement.
