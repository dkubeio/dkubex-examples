Virginias Insurance Marketplace is the only place where Virginians can apply for financial savings to help lower monthly health insurance costs. Ways to save include advance premium tax credits (APTCs) and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). Nearly 9 out of 10 Marketplace consumers qualify for financial assistance. Some Virginians may also qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Virginia Medicaid or FAMIS. Advanced Premium Tax CreditsAPTCs are tax credits you can use to lower your monthly health insurance payment (called the premium). This type of assistance is only available through the Marketplace and is based on household income level and family size.If your income changes, make sure you update your account information in the Marketplace. This helps to make sure you have access to all the financial savings you qualify for.Cost-Sharing ReductionsIf you qualify for an APTC, you may also be eligible for extra savings with CSRs. CSRs are discounts on the amount you pay for deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. If you qualify for CSRs, you must enroll in a plan on the Marketplace in the Silver category. Visit our FAQs page for an explanation of the plan categories.CSRs also lower your out-of-pocket maximum, which is the maximum amount youll pay for covered health services in a year. After you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, your insurance plan will pay 100% of covered health services.You may qualify for additional CSRs if youre a member of a federally recognized tribe or an Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act corporation shareholder.Use the steps below to calculate your household income.
