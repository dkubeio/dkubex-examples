Losing job-based coverage, even if you quit or get fired, may qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period, but only if you apply within 60 days of losing coverage.\n\nYour coverage can start the first day of the month after you lose your insurance.\n\nWhen you fill out a Virginia's Insurance Marketplace application, you'll find out if you qualify for savings on your monthly premiums and out-of-pocket healthcare costs based on your income.\nHowever, you may not be able to keep the same plan you had through your employer. When you apply for coverage, you will need to confirm if your healthcare provider is in network and/or if your current medications are covered.\nSign-up for COBRA coverage\nYou may be able to keep your job-based health plan through COBRA continuation coverage.\nCOBRA is a federal law that may let you pay to stay on your employee health insurance for a limited time after your job ends (usually 18 months).
