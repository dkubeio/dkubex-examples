Once you submit a Virginia's Insurance Marketplace application and Virginia's Insurance Marketplace believes your child likely qualifies for free or low-cost FAMIS coverage, their application information will be sent to the Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) to confirm. Virginia's Insurance Marketplace does not automatically send a child that is eligible for full-cost FAMIS directly over to DMAS to ensure that you can see their coverage options through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace."}
