When can I enroll?\n          \n        \nVirginia's Insurance Marketplace is there for you when the unexpected happens!\nIf the loss of your job occurred/occurs during Virginia's Insurance Marketplace open enrollment, which begins on November 1 and ends January 15\nth\n, you can apply for coverage right away. You can apply for health coverage outside of the open enrollment window with Virginia's Insurance Marketplace because the loss of job-based coverage is considered a qualifying life event that enables you to enroll through a special enrollment period as long as you do so within 60 days of losing your coverage. Visit\nwww.marketplace.viginia.gov\nand click on the yellow box labeled Get Covered.\nIf you need help applying, you can call Virginia's Insurance Marketplace Customer Service at 1-888-687-1501 (TTY: 711) to speak with a Virginia's Insurance Marketplace Customer Service Representative for guidance and direction.\nVirginians who lost their job and job-based healthcare coverage can also apply for Medical Assistance online through\ncommonhelp.virginia.gov\n. The individual will be reviewed for Medical Assistance from the date their application was submitted through COMPASS. If the individual is determined ineligible for\nMedical Assistance\n, their information will be transferred to Virginia's Insurance Marketplace or to\nFAMIS\n, which covers uninsured children under 19.\nNo matter if you apply through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace or Commonhelp, we are committed to ensuring your application gets to the right place so you can enroll in the health coverage that meets the needs of you and your family."}
