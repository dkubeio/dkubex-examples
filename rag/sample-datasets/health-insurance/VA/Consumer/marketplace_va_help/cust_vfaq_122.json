What are our options?\n          \n        \nIn Virgina, there are many ways to enroll your newborn in quality coverage. It is easy to add a newborn to your current marketplace plan through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace. The addition of a new baby qualifies you for a\nspecial enrollment period\noutside of the annual open enrollment period as long as you update your application and enroll the newborn in coverage within 60 days of birth. You can add your newborn to your existing coverage or their own coverage within your application. You and your newborn may also qualify for financial assistance to lower the cost of coverage.\nYou can also apply for coverage through the\nFamily Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan (FAMIS) or Medical Assistance\n, if they qualify, at any time throughout the year. These programs offer plans specifically tailored for children to ensure they can grow up healthy and happy!"}
