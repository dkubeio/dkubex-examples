What should I do?\n          \n        \nVirginia's Insurance Marketplace was created to help connect Virginians to the health insurance coverage that best meets their needs and circumstances, regardless of what types of coverage they qualify for or how they apply. With Virginia's Insurance Marketplace, this connected approach will lead you to the optimal solution.  You can apply whether or not you qualify for\nMedicaid (Medical Assistance)\nwith one of two options:\nOption One:\nVirginians who are interested in applying for healthcare coverage but are not sure if they qualify can go to\nCoverVA\nand complete a quick screening. The CoverVA screening will tell individuals which program they may qualify for based on their responses to the screening questions. If an individual is screened as potentially eligible for healthcare insurance coverage through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace and not Medicaid, they will be directed to apply directly through the www.marketplace.virginia.gov link on the screening results page.\nRegardless of the results of the screening, individuals may choose to apply for healthcare coverage through the CoverVA website.  If the individual is determined ineligible for Medicaid (called Medical Assistance in VA), their information will be transferred to either Virginia's Insurance Marketplace or the\nthe Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan (FAMIS)\n, which covers uninsured children under 19. There are no income limits for FAMIS.\n\nOption Two:\nShould you prefer to start off with Virginia's Insurance Marketplace because you are claiming your account that was transferred (with an access code) from Healthcare.gov and are questioning, based on a change in circumstances, that you might now be eligible for Medicaid (Medical Assistance), you can apply for health insurance coverage at\nwww.marketplace.virginia.gov\nand click the yellow box Get Covered at the top of the Virginia's Insurance Marketplace home page.\nIndividuals applying for healthcare coverage through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace who are assessed as potentially eligible for Medical Assistance or FAMIS by Virginia's Insurance Marketplace will have their application transferred to the Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) for a Medical Assistance or FAMIS eligibility determination.\nIf you need help setting up your Virginia's Insurance Marketplace account or the application process, you can call Virginia's Insurance Marketplace at 1-888-687-1501.\nIf you have questions about the CoverVA screening process or Medicaid (Medical Assistance) in general, you can call the Statewide Customer Service Center at\n833-5CALLVA\nto get more information.\n833-5CALLVA\nNo matter how you choose to apply, Virginia's Insurance Marketplace will work with you to find the best, most affordable and comprehensive health coverage."}
