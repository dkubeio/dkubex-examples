Will I still receive financial assistance through the new state program?\n          \n        \nVirginia's Insurance Marketplace uses the same standards to determine your ability to receive financial assistance to help pay for the cost of health coverage and care as Healthcare.gov. Your ability to receive\nAdvanced Premium Tax Credits (APTC)\nto lower the cost of your premium, or\nCost-sharing Reductions\nto lower the cost of using healthcare services, will not change because of the transition from Healthcare.gov to Virginia's Insurance Marketplace."}
