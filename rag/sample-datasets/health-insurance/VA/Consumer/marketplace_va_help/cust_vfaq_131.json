You may submit any of the following documents:\n\nA document issued by a federally recognized tribe indicating tribal membership;\n\nAn enrollment cards;\n\nA certificate of degree of Indian blood issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs;\n\nA tribal census documents; and/or\n\nAny document indicating affiliation with the tribe.\n\nMedicaid and FAMIS agencies may accept an individuals attestation regarding Indian status.
