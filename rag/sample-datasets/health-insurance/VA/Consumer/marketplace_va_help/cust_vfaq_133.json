During this process, you may be asked to provide documents to confirm the events that make you eligible. If your eligibility results don't say you need to provide documents, you don't have to. Simply pick a plan and enroll.\nIf your eligibility results say you have to provide documents, you should do so as soon as possible after you pick a plan. This will prevent a delay in your coverage starting. Follow the instructions on your Virginia's Insurance Marketplace notice for what documents to submit and how to submit them.\nNo matter if you need to submit documents to confirm a Special Enrollment Period, or not, you have\n60 days\nfrom the time of the event to enroll in coverage."}
