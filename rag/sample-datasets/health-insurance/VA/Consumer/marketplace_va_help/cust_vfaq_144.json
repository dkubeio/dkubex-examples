Losing health coverage qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period.\nWhen you fill out a Virginia's Insurance Marketplace application, you'll find out if you qualify for a private plan with premium tax credits and lower out-of-pocket costs. This will depend on your income and household size.\nIf you have retiree coverage and want to buy a Virginia's Insurance Marketplace plan instead, you can. But:\n\nYou can't get premium tax credits and other savings based on your income. This is true only if you're actually enrolled in retiree coverage. If you're\neligible for but not enrolled\nin retiree coverage, you may qualify for premium tax credits and lower out-of-pocket costs based on your household size and income.\n\nIf you voluntarily drop your retiree coverage, you\nwon't\nqualify for a Special Enrollment Period to enroll in a plan through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace. You will need to wait until the next Open Enrollment period to enroll in health coverage."}
