If a health plan includes dental benefits, the premium covers both health and dental coverage.\nPediatric dental care is considered an essential health benefit. This means if you're getting health coverage for someone 18 or younger, dental coverage must be available for your child either as part of a health plan or as a stand-alone plan.\nNOTE: While dental coverage for children must be available to you, you dont have to buy it.\nHowever, dental coverage isn't an essential health benefit for adults. Insurers don't have to offer adult dental coverage as part of their qualified health plan; however, stand-alone dental plans are available through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace. If you choose a separate dental plan, youll pay a separate, additional premium.\nThere are two categories of Virginia's Insurance Marketplace dental plans: High and low.\n\nThe high coverage level has higher premiums but lower co-payments and deductibles. So you'll pay more every month, but less when you use dental services.\n\nThe low coverage level has lower premiums but higher co-payments and deductibles. So you'll pay less every month, but more when you use dental services."}
