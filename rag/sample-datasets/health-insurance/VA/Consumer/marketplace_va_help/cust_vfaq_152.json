These protections apply to all health plans, whether you get coverage through your employer or buy it yourself.\nYour insurance company can still cancel your coverage if you purposely included false or incomplete information on your insurance application or if you don't pay your premiums on time.\nVirginia requires insurance companies to provide at least a\n30-day grace period\nbefore they can cancel your coverage for the reasons stated above. If you receive\nadvance premium tax credits,\nyou have a\n90-day grace period\nbefore your coverage can be terminated."}
