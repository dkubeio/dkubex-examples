These plans, known as ICHRAs or QSEHRAs, generally involve the employer contributing to the cost of health insurance on behalf of their employees, without offering group health insurance.\n\nIf you are offered an individual coverage HRA, that may impact your eligibility for a premium tax credit on Virginias Insurance Marketplace. To determine if you are eligible for a premium tax credit, you can complete the form at this\nlink\n.\n\nThere are some key differences between the two types.\n\nQualified Small Employer HRA (QSEHRA)\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act permits small employers who don't offer group health plan coverage to any of their employees to provide a QSEHRA to their eligible employees to help employees pay for medical care expenses.\n\nAn eligible employee can use a QSEHRA to reimburse medical care expenses for him or herself, as well as any covered dependents (if permitted by the employer).\n\nTo receive reimbursements from a QSEHRA, an employee and any covered dependents must be enrolled in minimum essential coverage (MEC).\n\nSmall employers can provide QSEHRAs for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.\n\nIndividual Coverage HRAs (ICHRAs)\n\nIf an employer offers an employee an ICHRA that is affordable, a premium tax credit (PTC) is not allowed for an individuals Marketplace coverage. This applies to employees as well as spouses and dependents of employees to whom the offer extends.\n\nIf the ICHRA is not affordable based on federal affordability standards, a PTC is allowed if the employee offered the coverage opts out of the HRA and the other PTC requirements are met.\n\nPTC is not allowed for an individuals Marketplace coverage if the individual chooses to be covered by an ICHRA, regardless of whether the HRA is affordable.\n\nIf you are offered an individual coverage HRA, that may impact your eligibility for a premium tax credit on Virginias Insurance Marketplace.
