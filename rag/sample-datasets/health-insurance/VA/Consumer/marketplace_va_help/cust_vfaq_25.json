They may be an affordable way to protect yourself from worst-case scenarios, like getting seriously sick or injured. But you pay most routine medical expenses yourself.\n\nPeople under 30\n\nPeople of any age with a hardship exemption or affordability exemption (based on Virginia's Insurance Marketplace or job-based insurance being unaffordable)\n\nMonthly premiums are usually low, but you can't use a premium tax credit to reduce your cost. If you qualify for a premium tax credit based on your income, a Bronze or Silver plan is likely to be a better value. Be sure to shop and compare to ensure you find a plan that best meets your needs.\nCatastrophic plans cover the same essential health benefits as other plans on Virginia's Insurance Marketplace.\nLike other plans, Catastrophic plans cover certain preventive services at no cost.\nThey also cover at least three primary care visits per year before you've met your deductible."}
