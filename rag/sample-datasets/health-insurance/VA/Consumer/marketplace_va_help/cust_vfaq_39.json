Catastrophic plans cover the same essential health benefits as other Virginia's Insurance Marketplace plans, and also cover certain preventive services at no cost.\nWhile premiums are generally lower for catastrophic coverage, those enrolled in these plans are not eligible for financial assistance to lower the cost of coverage and care. These plans feature very high deductibles, before the plan starts to pay anything. However, after you meet the deductible, your insurance company will pay for all covered services, with no copayment or coinsurance.\nIf you're 30 or older and want to enroll in a Catastrophic plan for 2021, you must claim a\nhardship exemption or affordability exemption\n(if your job-based coverage offer is not affordable) to qualify.
