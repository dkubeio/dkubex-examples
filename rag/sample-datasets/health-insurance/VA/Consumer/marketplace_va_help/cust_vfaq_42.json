Eligibility for financial assistance is based on your\nestimated net income for the year you're getting coverage, not last year's income.\n\n\n\nIf you leave a job for any reason and lose job-based insurance\n: You can buy an insurance plan using a Special Enrollment Period.

Your savings will be based on that estimate. When your income changes, you can update your application to adjust your coverage and savings.\n\nYou can choose from several categories of coverage from Virginia's Insurance Marketplace, from plans with low premiums that mainly protect you in worst-case scenarios to plans where you'll pay more each month but less out-of-pocket when you access healthcare services.\n\nIf you're under 30 or have a hardship exemption, you can pick a Catastrophic health plan - an inexpensive way to protect yourself from worst-case scenarios."}
