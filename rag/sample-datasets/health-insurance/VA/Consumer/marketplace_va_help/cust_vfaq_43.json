However, you will want to terminate your Virginia's Insurance Marketplace coverage as soon as you enroll in Medicare to avoid paying full-price for a plan through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace.\nIn most cases, it's to your advantage to sign up for Medicare when you're first eligible. Once youre eligible for Medicare, youll have an Initial Enrollment Period to sign up for Medicare. For most people, the Initial Enrollment Period starts 3 months before their 65th birthday and ends 3 months after their 65th birthday."}
