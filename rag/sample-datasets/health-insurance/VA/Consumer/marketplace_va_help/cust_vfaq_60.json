If you do not have your access code, you can enter your SSN to access your account.\n\nGo to the\nVirginia's Insurance Marketplace website\n, and click Get Covered, select Register with Access Code shown below\n\n\nEnter your Access Code provided in the notice you received from Virginia's Insurance Marketplace.\n\n\n\nAccess code page is set to access code tab by default.  If you do not have your access code, you can enter your SSN by clicking the SSN tab for the alternative method for claiming your account, as shown below.\n\n\n\nBe sure to check the\nI'm not a robot\nfunction and follow the steps to move forward with logging in, then click\nSubmit\n.\nIf you deleted the email and are unable to find your access code or cannot enter your SSN, please contact us for assistance."}
