Will I still be eligible to keep receiving Advanced Premium Tax Credits to lower my premium cost with Virginia's Insurance Marketplace?\n          \n        \nIndividuals (along with their spouse and dependents, if eligible) who receive an offer of job-based coverage that meets certain affordability standards are not eligible to receive Advanced Premium Tax Credits to lower the cost of coverage. Generally, job-based coverage is considered affordable if it costs less than 8.39% of an employees annual income.\nIf you are enrolled in a health insurance plan through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace and have recently received an offer of affordable job-based health insurance coverage, you will no longer be eligible to receive Advanced Premium Tax Credits to lower the cost of your premium through the marketplace. You may choose to remain enrolled in your marketplace coverage; however, you will be responsible for paying the full premium cost of coverage."}
