It is important to keep a copy of your insurance card for your records, as doctors offices will ask to see an insurance card for billing purposes. It can take up to 10 days to receive your insurance card(s) in the mail after you have enrolled in a plan, so do not worry! If you have not received a copy of your insurance card from your insurance carrier after a couple of weeks, or you have lost your insurance card, Virginia's Insurance Marketplace suggests contacting your insurance carrier directly for further assistance."}
