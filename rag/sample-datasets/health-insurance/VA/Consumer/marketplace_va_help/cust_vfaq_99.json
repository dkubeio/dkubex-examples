Why was my financial assistance changed or removed?\n          \n        \nYour monthly financial assistance may change (increase or decrease) or be removed altogether from your policy due to newly reported information on your Virginia's Insurance Marketplace application. Changes in your APTC amount may happen as a result of reported changes to your:\n\nIncome,\n\nFamily size,\n\nTax filing status\n\nFor example, if your household income increases, you may be eligible for less monthly APTC, and your monthly premium may increase. If your annual income decreases, you may be eligible for more APTC, and your premium may decrease.\nIn addition, if Virginia's Insurance Marketplace finds that you are eligible for affordable Minimum Essential Coverage outside of Virginia's Insurance Marketplace, you will be determined ineligible for financial assistance, and your APTC will be removed. For example, if you are eligible for Medicaid, you cannot receive financial assistance on Virginia's Insurance Marketplace coverage. In addition, if you report that you have an offer of affordable health coverage through your employer, you will be found ineligible for financial assistance on your Virginia's Insurance Marketplace account. For a more detailed summary on what might be impacting your financial assistance, you can reach out to Virginia's Insurance Marketplace Customer Service at 1-888-687-1501."}
