In addition to your premium, you usually have to pay other costs when accessing healthcare services, including\ndeductibles\n,\nco-payments\n,\nand\n\nco-insurance\n.\nIf you have a health plan through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace, you may be able to lower your monthly premium with a premium tax credit. After you enroll in a plan, you must pay your first premium directly to the insurance company - not to Virginia's Insurance Marketplace.\nWhen shopping for a plan, keep in mind that the plan with the lowest monthly premium may not be the best match for you.  If you plan on using your healthcare frequently, a plan with a slightly higher premium but a lower deductible may save you a lot of money."}
