All plans offered by Virginia's Insurance Marketplace include vision coverage for children. Only some plans include vision coverage for adults.\nIf adult vision coverage is important to you, check the details of any plan you're considering.\nIf your plan doesn't include adult vision coverage, you can buy a 'stand-alone' vision plan to reduce your vision care expenses. However, Virginia's Insurance Marketplace doesn't offer stand-alone vision plans. To shop for stand-alone vision plans, contact an insurance agent or broker, or search for plans online."}
