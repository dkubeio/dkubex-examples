The lower the metal tier, the lower your monthly premium, but the more out-of-pocket costs you'll need to pay when you use healthcare services.\nIt is important to look at the total cost of health coverage - not just premiums - when choosing the right health coverage for you and your family. Total costs also include deductibles, and other\nout-of-pocket costs\nlike\nco-payments\nand\nco-insurance\n.\nExample:\n\"Plan Category\",\"The insurance company pays\",\"You pay (co-insurance)\"\n\"Platinum\",\"90%\",\"10%\"\n\"Gold\",\"80%\",\"20%\"\n\"Silver\",\"70%\",\"30%\"\n\"Bronze\",\"60%\",\"40%\"\nWhich metal category is right for you?\n\nPlatinum\nHighest\nmonthly premium\nLowest\ncosts when you use healthcare services.\nDeductibles are very low, meaning your plan starts paying its share for covered services earlier than other plan categories.\nGood choice if:\nYou usually use a lot of care and are willing to pay a higher monthly premium, knowing nearly all other costs will be covered.\n\nGold\nHigher\nmonthly premium\nLower\ncosts when you use healthcare services\nGold plan deductibles are usually low.\nGood choice if:\nYoure willing to pay more each month to have more costs covered when you use healthcare services. If you use a lot of care, a Gold plan could be a good value.\n\nSilver\nModerate\nmonthly premium\nModerate\ncosts when you use healthcare services.\nSilver deductibles  the costs you pay yourself before your plan pays anything  are usually lower than those of Bronze plans.\nIMPORTANT:\nIf you qualify for\ncost-sharing reductions\nyou\nmust\npick a Silver plan to access these savings. You can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year depending on how much care you use.\nGood choice if:\nYou qualify for cost-sharing reductions or, if not, youre willing to pay a slightly higher monthly premium than Bronze to have more of your routine care covered.\n\nBronze\nLowest\nmonthly premium\nHighest\ncosts when you use healthcare services.\nBronze plan deductibles  the amount of healthcare costs you pay yourself before your insurance plan starts to pay  can be thousands of dollars a year.\nGood choice if:\nYou want a low-cost way to protect yourself from worst-case medical scenarios, like a serious illness or injury. Your monthly premium will be low, but youll have to pay for most routine care yourself.\n\nCatastrophic\nCatastrophic health insurance plans have low monthly premiums and very high deductibles. They may be an affordable way to protect yourself from worst-case scenarios, like getting seriously sick or injured. But you pay most routine medical expenses yourself.\nOnly the following people are eligible for catastrophic plans:\nPeople under 30\nPeople of any age with a hardship exemption or affordability exemption (based on Virginia's Insurance Marketplace or job-based insurance being unaffordable)"}
