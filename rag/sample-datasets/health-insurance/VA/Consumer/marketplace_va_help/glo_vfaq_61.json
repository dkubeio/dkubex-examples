For example, if your plan has a $2,000 deductible, you must pay the first $2,000 out-of-pocket for covered services.\nAfter you pay your deductible, you will generally only be required to pay a co-payment or co-insurance for covered services. Your insurance company will cover the rest.\n\nAll health plans purchased through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace will pay the full cost of certain preventive benefits prior to you meeting your deductible.\n\nMany plans will pay for certain preventive services, like a check-up or disease management programs, prior to you satisfying the deductible. Check your plan details.\n\nSome plans have separate deductibles for certain services, like prescription drugs.\n\nFamily plans often have both an individual deductible, which applies to each person, and a family deductible, which applies to all family members.\n\nGenerally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher deductibles. Plans with higher monthly premiums generally have lower deductibles."}
