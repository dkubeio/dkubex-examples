If a job-based plan is \"affordable,\" and meets the minimum value standard, you're not eligible for a\npremium tax credit\nif you buy coverage through Virginia's Insurance Marketplace instead.\nThe plan used to define affordability is the lowest priced \"self-only\" plan the employer offers - meaning a plan covering only the employee, not dependents. This is true even if you're enrolled in a plan that costs more or covers dependents.\nThe cost is the amount the employee would pay for the insurance, not the plan's total premium.\nThe employee's total household income is used. Total household income includes income from everybody in the household who's required to file a tax return.\nExample 1\n\nEmployee's monthly household income = $4,083 (about $49,000 per year)\n\n83% of the employee's monthly household income = $372\n\nMonthly cost to the employee of the lowest-priced plan the employer offers for self-only coverage = $300\n\nThis plan is considered affordable job-based coverage as the monthly cost to the employee ($300) is less than 8.39% of the employee's monthly household income ($372).\n\nExample 2\n\nEmployees monthly household income = $2,333 (about $28,000 per year)\n\n83% of the employees monthly household income = $212.77\n\nMonthly cost to the employee of the lowest-priced plan the employer offers for self-only coverage = $275\n\nIs the plan affordable? NO. The employees share of the lowest-cost self-only plan ($275) is more than 8.39% of the employees household income ($212.77).\n\nTo find out if your employers plan meets the affordability standard, ask your employer."}
