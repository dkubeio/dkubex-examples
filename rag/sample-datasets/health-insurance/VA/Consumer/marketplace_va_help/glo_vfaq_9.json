If youre married, your spouse can put up to $3,050 in an FSA with their employer too. You aren't taxed on this money. If money is left at the end of the year, the employer can offer one of two options (not both):\n\nYou get 2.5 more months to spend the left over money.\n\nYou can carry over up to $610 to spend the next plan year."}
